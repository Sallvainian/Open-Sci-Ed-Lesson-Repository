# BMAD-METHOD Agents and Tasks (OpenCode)

OpenCode reads AGENTS.md during initialization as part of its system prompt. This section is auto-generated by BMAD-METHOD.

## How To Use With OpenCode

- Run `opencode` in this project directory
- OpenCode will read your `opencode.json` or `opencode.jsonc` configuration
- Reference agents by their ID in your prompts (e.g., "As dev, implement...")
- Update this section after changes: `npx bmad install -i opencode`

nfr_validation:
  _assessed: [security, performance, reliability, maintainability]
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Environment variables properly configured, no hardcoded secrets, CORS configured in Story 1.3"
  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "No performance targets defined; framework choices are optimized (Next.js, TanStack Query) but explicit budgets recommended"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "API client error handling planned for network errors, 4xx, 5xx; TanStack Query provides automatic retries"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "TypeScript strict mode, 70%+ test coverage target, comprehensive documentation planned, colocated tests"

recommendations:
  immediate:
    - "Follow provider nesting pattern in docs/qa/assessments/1.4-risk-20251003.md"
    - "Validate provider tree renders with integration test"
  future:
    - "Add performance budgets to docs/architecture/technology-stack.md"
    - "Consider visual regression tests for styling validation (AC5)"

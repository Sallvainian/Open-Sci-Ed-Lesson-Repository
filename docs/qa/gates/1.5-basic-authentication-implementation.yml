  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "bcrypt intentionally slow for security (PERF-001 accepted). Middleware overhead minimal (TECH-002)."

# Accepted risks (medium/low priority)
accepted_risks:
  PERF-001:
    reason: "bcrypt intentionally slow for security (SALT_ROUNDS=10 industry standard)"
    impact: "Login may take 200-500ms, acceptable for security benefit"
  TECH-001:
    reason: "Server-side token verification is authoritative, client optimization deferred"
    impact: "Expired tokens used until server rejects, graceful 401 handling implemented"
  DATA-001:
    reason: "8-hour token expiration acceptable for MVP, cookie persistence working"
    impact: "Session expires after 8 hours, acceptable for teacher workflow"
  TECH-002:
    reason: "Next.js middleware designed for this use case, performance acceptable"
    impact: "Minimal overhead, monitoring in place"
  OPS-002:
    reason: "Stateless JWT design, no token blacklist (accepted architectural choice)"
    impact: "Stolen tokens valid until expiration (8 hours), short expiration mitigates risk"
  BUS-001:
    reason: "Single hardcoded user is explicit MVP requirement (AC 3)"
    impact: "No multi-user support, planned for future database migration"

# Final quality assessment
final_assessment: |
  Story 1.5 achieves PASS with exceptional quality:

  âœ… **Completeness**: 10/10 acceptance criteria fully implemented
  âœ… **Security**: All 5 critical security risks (SEC-001 to SEC-005) successfully mitigated
  âœ… **Testing**: 68 tests passing (100% pass rate), comprehensive coverage across unit/integration/component levels
  âœ… **Code Quality**: Zero ESLint errors, TypeScript strict mode, proper separation of concerns
  âœ… **Architecture**: Follows Next.js 14.x App Router best practices, ready for production deployment

  ðŸŸ¡ **Accepted Limitations**:
  - Single hardcoded user (explicit MVP requirement)
  - No token blacklist on logout (stateless JWT design choice)
  - Authentication monitoring deferred (logging present, alerting future enhancement)

  **No blocking issues identified. Story ready for production deployment.**

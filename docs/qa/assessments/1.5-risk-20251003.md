Date: 2025-10-03
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- **Total Risks Identified**: 12
- **Critical Risks**: 3
- **High Risks**: 3
- **Medium Risks**: 4
- **Low Risks**: 2
- **Risk Score**: 35/100 (High Risk - Requires careful mitigation)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-001: JWT Secret Management Vulnerability

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High (3) - Environment variable misconfiguration is common in MVP development
**Impact**: High (3) - Weak or exposed JWT_SECRET allows token forgery, complete authentication bypass

**Affected Components**:

- `lib/auth/jwt.ts` (token generation/verification)
- `.env.local`, `.env.example` (configuration)

**Mitigation**:

- Generate cryptographically strong JWT_SECRET (min 32 characters, random)
- Never commit JWT_SECRET to repository
- Use different secrets for dev/staging/production
- Document secret generation process in README
- Add pre-commit hook to detect accidentally committed secrets

**Testing Focus**:

- Test with weak secrets (should still work but log warning)
- Test token forgery attempts with known secrets
- Verify environment variable loading
- Security audit of secret storage

**Residual Risk**: Low - With proper controls, secret compromise highly unlikely

---

### 2. SEC-002: Password Storage and Validation

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Implementation error possible with bcrypt salt rounds or comparison
**Impact**: High (3) - Incorrect hashing allows password compromise, authentication bypass

**Affected Components**:

- `lib/auth/password.ts` (hashing/verification)
- `lib/auth/constants.ts` (hardcoded credential)
- `app/api/auth/login/route.ts` (password verification)

**Mitigation**:

- Use bcrypt.hash with SALT_ROUNDS = 10 (industry standard)
- Use timing-safe bcrypt.compare (prevents timing attacks)
- Never log passwords or hashes
- Test password verification with known good/bad passwords
- Code review password handling thoroughly

**Testing Focus**:

- Unit test password hashing produces different hashes for same input
- Unit test valid password verification returns true
- Unit test invalid password verification returns false
- Performance test bcrypt operations (should be intentionally slow)
- Security test timing attack resistance

**Residual Risk**: Very Low - bcrypt is battle-tested, risk is implementation error

---

### 3. SEC-003: Token Exposure via Client Storage

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - localStorage implementation instead of httpOnly cookies
**Impact**: High (3) - XSS attacks can steal tokens from localStorage

**Affected Components**:

- `app/api/auth/login/route.ts` (cookie setting)
- `app/login/page.tsx` (client-side token handling)
- `middleware.ts` (token extraction)

**Mitigation**:

- **REQUIRED**: Use httpOnly cookies for token storage (AC 5)
- Set secure flag in production (HTTPS only)
- Set sameSite: 'lax' for CSRF protection
- Never expose token to client JavaScript
- Implement CSP headers to prevent XSS

**Testing Focus**:

- Verify cookie is httpOnly and not accessible via document.cookie
- Verify secure flag set in production environment
- Test XSS prevention with malicious input
- Integration test token persists across refresh

**Residual Risk**: Low - httpOnly cookies prevent most XSS token theft

---

## High Priority Risks

### 4. SEC-004: Insufficient Input Validation on Login Form

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High (3) - Easy to miss validation edge cases
**Impact**: Medium (2) - SQL injection, XSS, or denial of service

**Affected Components**:

- `app/api/auth/login/route.ts` (server-side validation)
- `app/login/page.tsx` (client-side validation)
- `lib/validation/schemas.ts` (Zod schemas)

**Mitigation**:

- Use Zod for runtime validation on both client and server
- Sanitize username input (alphanumeric only recommended)
- Limit password length (max 128 characters prevents DoS)
- Return generic error for invalid credentials (prevent username enumeration)
- Rate limit login attempts (future enhancement)

**Testing Focus**:

- Test SQL injection attempts in username/password
- Test XSS payloads in input fields
- Test extremely long inputs (>1000 chars)
- Test special characters and Unicode
- Verify generic error messages don't leak info

---

### 5. SEC-005: Username Enumeration via Error Messages

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Dev notes mention "clear error message" which could leak info
**Impact**: High (3) - Attackers can enumerate valid usernames for targeted attacks

**Affected Components**:

- `app/api/auth/login/route.ts` (error responses)

**Mitigation**:

- **CRITICAL**: Return identical error for invalid username AND invalid password
- Use generic message: "Invalid username or password" (AC 10 correctly specifies this)
- Ensure identical response timing for both error cases
- Log actual reason server-side for debugging
- Never expose whether username or password was incorrect

**Testing Focus**:

- Test invalid username returns same error as invalid password
- Test timing is similar for both error paths
- Verify error message is generic
- Security audit error responses

---

### 6. OPS-001: Missing Authentication Monitoring and Alerting

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High (3) - MVP scope doesn't include monitoring
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Failed login attacks go undetected

**Affected Components**:

- `app/api/auth/login/route.ts` (needs logging)
- Infrastructure (future monitoring)

**Mitigation**:

- Log all authentication events (success/failure) with timestamp and IP
- Monitor for repeated failed login attempts
- Alert on suspicious patterns (brute force attempts)
- Consider rate limiting in future iteration
- Add structured logging for SIEM integration

**Testing Focus**:

- Verify login attempts are logged
- Test log format is parseable
- Integration test logging doesn't block authentication

**Residual Risk**: Medium - Monitoring is out of MVP scope but should be prioritized

---

## Medium Priority Risks

### 7. PERF-001: bcrypt Performance Impact on Login

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - bcrypt is intentionally slow
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Login response time >500ms may feel sluggish

**Affected Components**:

- `lib/auth/password.ts` (bcrypt operations)
- `app/api/auth/login/route.ts` (login endpoint)

**Mitigation**:

- Accept intentional slowness for security
- Set SALT_ROUNDS = 10 (balances security and performance)
- Consider async operation to avoid blocking
- Document expected response time
- Monitor login endpoint performance

**Testing Focus**:

- Performance test login endpoint response time
- Load test with concurrent login attempts

- `lib/auth/middleware.ts` (server verification)
- Frontend components using auth state

**Mitigation**:

- Server-side verification is authoritative (already in design)
- Client-side expiration check is optimization only
- Decode JWT client-side to check exp claim
- Proactively redirect to login before token expires
- Handle 401 responses gracefully

**Testing Focus**:

- Test expired token rejected by server
- Test client handles 401 gracefully
- Integration test token expiration flow

**Residual Risk**: Low - Server enforcement is sufficient

---

### 9. DATA-001: Session Persistence Across Browser Refresh

**Score: 4 (Medium)**

**Affected Components**:

- `app/api/auth/login/route.ts` (cookie maxAge)
- `middleware.ts` (token verification on page load)
- Auth context provider

**Mitigation**:

- Set cookie maxAge to 8 hours (matches token expiration)
- Use path: '/' for app-wide cookie access
- Test across browser refresh and navigation
- Document cookie persistence behavior
- Handle edge cases (private browsing, cookie disabled)

**Testing Focus**:

- Test authentication persists after browser refresh
- Test cookie expiration matches token expiration
- Test navigation between pages maintains auth
- E2E test complete session lifecycle

---

### 10. TECH-002: Middleware Performance on Every Request

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Low (1) - Next.js middleware is optimized
**Impact**: High (3) - Authentication check on every request adds latency

**Affected Components**:

- `middleware.ts` (runs on every request)
- `lib/auth/jwt.ts` (token verification)

**Mitigation**:

- Verify token only once per request (current design)
- Use efficient JWT library (jsonwebtoken is fast)
- Cache verification results where appropriate
- Monitor middleware execution time
- Consider edge runtime for faster execution

**Testing Focus**:

- Performance test middleware overhead
- Load test with many concurrent authenticated requests
- Verify middleware doesn't become bottleneck

**Residual Risk**: Low - Next.js middleware is designed for this use case

---

## Low Priority Risks

### 11. OPS-002: Logout Doesn't Invalidate JWT Server-Side

**Score: 3 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low (1) - Logout clears cookie, but token remains valid
**Impact**: High (3) - Stolen tokens usable until expiration

**Affected Components**:

- `app/api/auth/logout/route.ts` (only clears cookie)
- JWT verification (no token blacklist)

**Mitigation**:

- Accept limitation for MVP (stateless JWT design)
- Document: tokens valid until expiration even after logout
- Keep token expiration short (8 hours is reasonable)
- Consider token blacklist in future iteration
- Monitor for suspicious post-logout token usage

**Testing Focus**:

- Document behavior in test cases
- Verify logout clears cookie
- Security note: stolen token usable until expiration

**Residual Risk**: Accepted for MVP - Token blacklist adds complexity

---

### 12. BUS-001: Single Hardcoded User Limits Usability

**Score: 2 (Low)**

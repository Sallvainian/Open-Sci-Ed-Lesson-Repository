## Risk Summary YAML Block

Paste this block into the gate file under `risk_summary`:

```yaml
risk_summary:
  totals:
    critical: 1 # SEC-001: Production error message information leakage
    high: 2 # TECH-001: Test helper mismatch, OPS-001: Test flakiness
    medium: 1 # TECH-002: Environment stub cleanup
    low: 4 # SEC-002, TECH-003, OPS-002, PERF-001
  highest:
    id: SEC-001
    score: 9
    title: 'Production error message information leakage'
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - 'Implement environment-specific error message tests (1.9-UNIT-010, 1.9-UNIT-011)'
      - 'Implement environment-specific logging tests (1.9-UNIT-012, 1.9-UNIT-013)'
      - 'Complete security review validating no information disclosure in production'
      - 'Validate Prisma clientVersion matches package.json (5.22.0)'
      - 'Verify all React tests use waitFor() for async assertions'
    monitor:
      - 'Test flakiness rate (target: 0% over 100 runs)'
      - 'Coverage percentage (target: ≥95% overall)'
      - 'Production error logs for information leakage'
      - 'Test suite execution time (baseline: <10 seconds for 22 tests)'
```

## Test Design YAML Block

Paste this block into the gate file under `test_design`:

```yaml
test_design:
  scenarios_total: 22
  by_level:
    unit: 20 # 90.9% - Error handler logic (14), Header component states (6)
    integration: 2 # 9.1% - Health endpoint error paths
    e2e: 0 # 0% - No user-facing workflows to validate
  by_priority:
    p0: 18 # 81.8% - Security-critical error handling, environment-specific behavior
    p1: 4 # 18.2% - Health endpoint errors, Header component UX
    p2: 0 # 0% - All scenarios are critical
    p3: 0 # 0% - All scenarios are critical
  coverage_gaps: [] # All ACs have test coverage
  test_files:
    new:
      - 'lib/api/errorHandler.test.ts' # 14 unit tests (P0)
      - 'components/layout/Header.test.tsx' # 6 unit tests (P1)
    modified:
      - 'app/api/health/route.test.ts' # +2 integration tests (P1)
  execution_time_estimate: '15 seconds' # All 22 tests
  coverage_targets:
    error_handler: '95%+' # from 27.77%
    health_endpoint: '100%' # from 68.96%
    header_component: '100%' # from 66.66%
    overall_project: '95%+' # from 58.93%
```

## Combined Gate Status Summary

**Gate Determination**: CONCERNS → PASS (after mitigation)

**Reasoning**:

- Critical security risk (SEC-001, score 9) requires comprehensive testing
- High technical/operational risks (TECH-001, OPS-001) require validation
- All risks are mitigable through planned test implementation
- Security review required before production deployment

**Progression Path**:

1. **Before Testing**: FAIL (SEC-001 unmitigated, no validation)
2. **After Unit Tests**: CONCERNS (tests exist, need execution validation)
3. **After Security Review**: PASS (all mitigations verified)

**Required Actions for PASS**:

- ✅ Implement all 22 test scenarios
- ✅ Verify environment-specific tests validate security (SEC-001)
- ✅ Confirm test helpers match actual error structures (TECH-001)
- ✅ Validate no test flakiness in 10 consecutive runs (OPS-001)
- ✅ Complete security review sign-off
- ✅ Achieve coverage targets (95%+ overall)

## Quality Metrics Summary

**Risk Score**: 71/100 (moderate risk, fully mitigable)
**Test Coverage**: 22 scenarios (100% AC coverage)
**Priority Distribution**: 81.8% P0 (security-critical)
**Execution Speed**: <15 seconds (fast feedback)
**Test Level Efficiency**: 90.9% unit (appropriate for error logic)

**Overall Assessment**: Story ready for implementation with comprehensive test strategy and clear risk mitigation path.

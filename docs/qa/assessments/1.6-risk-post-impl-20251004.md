## Remaining High Risks (Require Attention)

### 1. [OPS-002]: Missing Comprehensive Monitoring Infrastructure

**Score: 6 (High Risk - Orange)**
**Category**: Operational
**Probability**: High (3) - Basic notifications only, no APM/error tracking
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Silent failures possible, delayed incident response

**Description**:
While basic deployment notifications are enabled (AC 9), comprehensive monitoring still missing:

- ❌ No Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
- ❌ No error tracking beyond console/Vercel logs
- ❌ No uptime monitoring service
- ❌ No custom metrics dashboard
- ✅ Vercel deployment notifications configured (partial mitigation)

**Current Mitigation Status**:

- ✅ **Immediate (Complete)**: Vercel deployment notifications enabled
- ⚠️ **Near-term (Pending)**: Basic uptime monitoring not yet added
- ⚠️ **Future (Pending)**: Sentry/APM integration planned but not implemented

**Recommendation**:

- Create Epic 2 story for comprehensive monitoring
- Add UptimeRobot/Checkly for basic uptime checks (free tier)
- Consider Sentry integration when budget allows

**Residual Risk**: Medium-High - Basic alerting mitigates acute failures, but lack of proactive monitoring remains

**Owner**: Product Owner
**Timeline**: Epic 2 story creation recommended

---

### 2. [TECH-004]: CI Pipeline Database Dependency Risk (NEW)

**Score: 4 (Medium Risk - Yellow)**
**Category**: Technical
**Probability**: Medium (2) - PostgreSQL service required for CI
**Impact**: Medium (2) - CI failures block all PRs

**Description**:
Implementation added PostgreSQL service to CI workflow (lines 13-26 in ci.yml) to support Prisma migrations and database tests. This creates new operational dependency:

**New Dependencies**:

- PostgreSQL 17 container must start successfully
- Database health checks must pass
- Prisma migrations must complete
- Test database state must be clean

**Potential Failure Modes**:

- PostgreSQL container fails to start → All CI runs fail
- Migration conflicts from concurrent PRs
- Database connection timeouts
- Port 5432 conflicts (unlikely in GitHub Actions)

**Mitigation**:

- ✅ Health checks configured (pg_isready with retries)
- ✅ Dedicated test database credentials (isolated from dev)
- ✅ `pnpm prisma migrate deploy` runs before tests
- ⚠️ No fallback if PostgreSQL service fails

**Testing Evidence**:

- CI passing with PostgreSQL service (verified Task 5)
- 68 tests passing with database connectivity

**Residual Risk**: Low-Medium - Mature PostgreSQL container, health checks in place

**Owner**: Dev team
**Timeline**: Monitor during first 2 weeks of regular use

---

## Low Risks (Acceptable)

### 3. [SEC-002]: VERCEL_TOKEN GitHub Secret Compromise

**Score: 1 (Minimal - Blue)**

- Using Vercel GitHub Integration (recommended approach)
- No VERCEL_TOKEN needed → Risk eliminated
- **Status**: ✅ Not applicable with current implementation

### 4. [TECH-001]: CI Cache Corruption

**Score: 2 (Low - Green)**

- pnpm caching configured correctly (`cache: 'pnpm'`)
- GitHub Actions caching is mature and reliable
- **Status**: ✅ Acceptable risk with standard mitigation

### 5. [TECH-002]: Deployment Approach Decision

**Score: 1 (Minimal - Blue)**

- Decision made: Vercel GitHub Integration (recommended)
- No deploy.yml created (per recommendation)
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved - Decision executed correctly

### 6. [TECH-003]: Dependency Version Mismatch

**Score: 2 (Low - Green)**

- `--frozen-lockfile` in CI ensures exact match
- pnpm 10 used consistently
- **Status**: ✅ Standard best practice implemented

### 7. [PERF-001]: Slow CI Pipeline

**Score: 2 (Low - Green)**

- CI runtime observed: <3 minutes with caching
- Parallel jobs working correctly
- PostgreSQL health checks add minimal overhead (<30s)
- **Status**: ✅ Performance acceptable

### 8. [BUS-001]: Process Too Complex

**Score: 1 (Minimal - Blue)**

- Vercel Integration is beginner-friendly
- README documentation comprehensive
- **Status**: ✅ Process well-documented

## Risk Score Improvement Analysis

**Pre-Implementation Score**: 46/100 (Moderate-High Risk)
**Post-Implementation Score**: 72/100 (Low-Moderate Risk)
**Improvement**: +26 points (+56% improvement) ✅

**Risk Resolution Summary**:

- ✅ 3 High risks resolved (OPS-001, DATA-001, SEC-001 downgraded)
- ✅ 1 Low risk resolved (OPS-003)
- ⚠️ 1 High risk remains (OPS-002 - monitoring)
- ⚠️ 1 New medium risk identified (TECH-004 - CI database dependency)

---

## Monitoring Requirements (Updated)

### ✅ Currently Implemented (Immediate)

1. GitHub commit status (deployment success/failure)
2. Vercel deployment notifications (email/Slack)
3. Health endpoint monitoring capability (`/api/health`)
4. CI workflow run history visibility

### ⚠️ Still Needed (Near-Term - Epic 2)

5. Uptime monitoring service (UptimeRobot/Checkly)
6. Error tracking integration (Sentry recommended)
7. Performance metrics dashboard
8. Custom alerts for critical thresholds

---

## Post-Implementation Recommendations

### ✅ Completed Actions

1. ✅ End-to-end deployment verification (Task 5)
2. ✅ Security code review (no secret exposure)
3. ✅ Production database connectivity validation
4. ✅ Rollback procedure documentation and testing
5. ✅ CI/CD pipeline documentation in README

### 📋 Immediate Follow-Up Actions

1. **Create Epic 2 Monitoring Story** (addresses OPS-002):
   - UptimeRobot integration for uptime monitoring
   - Basic error logging strategy
   - Vercel Analytics review
   - Future: Sentry integration planning

2. **Monitor PostgreSQL CI Service** (addresses TECH-004):
   - Track CI failure rates over next 2 weeks
   - Document any PostgreSQL service issues
   - Consider fallback strategy if stability issues arise

### 🔄 Ongoing Practices

3. **Security Vigilance** (maintains SEC-001 mitigation):
   - Code review checklist includes secret scanning
   - Periodic git history scans (`git log -S JWT_SECRET`)
   - Never log environment variables in code

4. **Performance Monitoring** (maintains PERF-001 low risk):
   - Monitor CI run times weekly
   - Investigate if average exceeds 5 minutes
   - Clear GitHub Actions cache if corruption suspected

## Integration with Quality Gates

**Quality Gate Decision** (Deterministic Mapping):

- Any risk score ≥ 9: Gate = FAIL
- Else if any score ≥ 6: Gate = **CONCERNS** ← Current State (1 high risk remains)
- Else: Gate = PASS

**Current Gate Status**: **CONCERNS** (improved from pre-implementation CONCERNS)

**Gate Rationale**:

- ✅ Major improvement: 3 high risks resolved through implementation
- ⚠️ OPS-002 (monitoring) remains high risk - requires Epic 2 story
- ✅ All critical deployment/security/data risks mitigated
- ⚠️ New medium risk (TECH-004) identified but acceptable with monitoring
- **Overall**: Implementation successful, monitoring gap documented

**Recommendation**: Story 1.6 can proceed to **Done** status with monitoring story planned for Epic 2.

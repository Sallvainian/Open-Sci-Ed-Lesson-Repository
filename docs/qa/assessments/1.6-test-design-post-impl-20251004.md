# Test Design: Story 1.6 - CI/CD Pipeline Configuration (Post-Implementation)

Date: 2025-10-04
Designer: Quinn (Test Architect)
Review Type: Post-Implementation Test Validation

## Test Strategy Overview

**Infrastructure Story Context**: Story 1.6 is a CI/CD configuration story, not a feature story. The implementation added **infrastructure configuration** (GitHub Actions workflows, README documentation) rather than application code. Therefore:

- **No new unit tests** required (no testable application logic added)
- **Verification tests** dominate (configuration validation, setup checks)
- **Integration tests** validate workflows (CI pipeline, deployment flow)
- **Existing test suite** (68 tests from Story 1.5) runs in CI pipeline

**Test Distribution**:

- Total test scenarios: 24
- Verification tests: 18 (75%) - Configuration and setup validation
- Integration tests: 6 (25%) - End-to-end workflow execution
- Unit tests: 0 (0%) - No application code added

**Priority Distribution**:

- P0 (Critical): 12 scenarios (50%) - Must pass before production
- P1 (High): 8 scenarios (33%) - Core functionality validation
- P2 (Medium): 4 scenarios (17%) - Secondary validation

**Estimated Execution Time**: 70-100 minutes (1.2-1.7 hours)

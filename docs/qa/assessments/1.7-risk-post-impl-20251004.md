---

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-001: Environment Secrets Exposure

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Category:** Security
**Probability:** High (3) - Manual configuration prone to human error
**Impact:** High (3) - Database compromise, unauthorized access, data breach

**Description:**
Production database credentials and API keys configured manually in Vercel dashboard could be accidentally committed to Git, exposed in logs, or misconfigured with incorrect scopes.

**Affected Components:**

- Vercel environment variables configuration
- `.env.local` file (risk of accidental commit)
- Supabase service role key (admin-level access)
- Database connection strings

**Mitigation Strategy: Preventive**

**Actions:**

1. Verify `.env.local` in `.gitignore` before ANY configuration
2. Use Vercel secrets naming convention (`@database_url`) exclusively
3. Implement secret scanning in CI pipeline (Gitleaks or similar)
4. Restrict `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` to production scope only
5. Use separate credentials for dev/staging/production
6. Document secret rotation procedure

**Testing Requirements:**

- Pre-deployment checklist verification
- Git history scan for leaked secrets
- Vercel dashboard audit (correct secret scopes)
- Secret rotation procedure dry-run

**Residual Risk:** Low - With proper procedures, risk minimal
**Owner:** Dev team + Operations
**Timeline:** BEFORE any environment variable configuration

### 2. DATA-001: Production Database Migration Failure

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Category:** Data
**Probability:** High (3) - First production migration, no rollback tested
**Impact:** High (3) - Data corruption, application unusable, extended downtime

**Description:**
Database migration (`pnpm db:migrate`) executed directly against production Supabase database without rollback plan. Failed migration could leave schema in inconsistent state.

**Affected Components:**

- Prisma migrations in `prisma/migrations/`
- Production Supabase database
- Seed script (`prisma/seed.ts`)
- Application startup (depends on correct schema)

**Mitigation Strategy: Preventive + Corrective**

**Actions:**

1. Create pre-migration backup via Supabase dashboard
2. Test migration against Supabase staging/preview environment first
3. Document rollback procedure:
   - Restore from backup point
   - Revert migration via Prisma
4. Verify migration idempotency (safe to re-run)
5. Run migration during low-traffic window
6. Monitor database logs during migration

**Testing Requirements:**

- Migration dry-run against staging database
- Rollback procedure validation
- Seed script idempotency testing
- Schema verification queries post-migration

**Residual Risk:** Medium - Database operations inherently risky
**Owner:** Dev team (primary) + DBA review (if available)
**Timeline:** BEFORE running production migration (AC#5)

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production Deployment

1. **SEC-001:** Environment secrets exposure - MUST mitigate fully
2. **DATA-001:** Database migration failure - MUST have rollback plan
3. **OPS-001:** Vercel configuration - MUST test in preview first
4. **TECH-001:** Connection pooling - MUST configure correctly
5. **PERF-001:** Health check latency - MUST implement timeout

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- **OPS-002:** 24-hour monitoring - Deploy with manual monitoring plan
- **SEC-002:** Storage bucket - Deploy with RLS policies, verify immediately
- **Medium risks:** Accept with documented compensating controls

### Accepted Risks (With Justification)

- **BUS-001:** Timeline delays - Acceptable with communication to stakeholders
- **PERF-003:** Web Vitals - Monitor post-deployment, iterate if needed
- **OPS-004:** Analytics - Already configured, low verification effort

---

## Monitoring Requirements Post-Deployment

### Critical Monitoring (First 24 Hours)

1. **Health Check Endpoint:**
   - Ping every 5 minutes
   - Alert on 2 consecutive failures
   - Track response time trends

2. **Database Metrics (Supabase Dashboard):**
   - Connection count
   - Query performance
   - Error rates
   - Backup execution status

3. **Vercel Deployment Logs:**
   - Function errors (HTTP 500)
   - Build failures
   - Edge network errors
   - Request volumes

4. **Web Vitals (Vercel Analytics):**
   - LCP (target <3s)
   - FID (target <100ms)
   - CLS (target <0.1)

### Ongoing Monitoring (Post-24 Hours)

- Weekly backup verification
- Monthly secret rotation review
- Quarterly disaster recovery drill
- Continuous Web Vitals tracking

---

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update this risk profile when:

1. **Immediate Triggers:**
   - Any critical risk materializes (SEC-001, DATA-001)
   - Production incident occurs
   - New deployment configuration changes

2. **Periodic Triggers:**
   - Before major releases
   - Quarterly security reviews
   - After architecture changes

3. **Environmental Triggers:**
   - Vercel platform updates
   - Supabase service changes
   - New security vulnerabilities disclosed

---

## Quality Gate Impact

**Deterministic Gate Mapping:**

- **2 Critical Risks (Score 9)** → Gate Decision: **CONCERNS**
  - Would be FAIL if unmitigated
  - Can proceed with documented mitigation plans
  - Requires explicit acceptance of residual risk

**Justification:**
Infrastructure stories inherently carry higher risk. With proper mitigation strategies documented and tested, deployment can proceed under controlled conditions with enhanced monitoring.

**Recommendation:** Proceed to implementation with mandatory execution of Priority 1 and Priority 2 tests before production deployment.

# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Reduce science lesson planning time by 40% through efficient content organization and instant material access
- Achieve <30 second retrieval time for any upcoming lesson's complete materials and teaching resources
- Establish a structured, predictable lesson planning workflow that eliminates content preparation surprises
- Organize one full OpenSciEd unit (8-12 lessons minimum) with complete lesson pages following consistent template structure
- Create dual navigation system supporting both conceptual browsing (Discipline → Unit → Lesson) and chronological sequencing (pacing guide order)
- Enable confident, well-prepared science instruction through comprehensive, accessible lesson material repository

## Background Context

The Open Science Education Lesson Repository addresses a critical challenge facing early-career science teachers: information overload from comprehensive curriculum materials like OpenSciEd. While OpenSciEd provides excellent content, its sheer volume creates significant barriers to efficient lesson planning. Teachers spend excessive time navigating multiple platforms and searching through scattered resources, which undermines the foundation of effective instruction. This tool recognizes that "good teaching requires good planning" and that the solution is not more content creation, but better content organization.

This project focuses 90% on organizing existing materials and 10% on creation capabilities, deliberately simplifying scope to solve the core problem: making everything findable without extensive searching. The tool supports the reality that teachers think about lessons in two ways—conceptually (by discipline and unit) and chronologically (by teaching sequence)—requiring flexible navigation that accommodates both mental models. By providing structured hierarchy, consistent lesson page templates, and hosted resources within a single platform, the repository transforms overwhelming curriculum volume into a curated, accessible planning workflow tailored to individual teaching practice.

# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The interface should feel like a professional reference library rather than a complex software application. Visual design emphasizes clarity, quick scanning, and immediate access to information without unnecessary clicks. The aesthetic should convey organization, reliability, and calm—supporting focused planning rather than adding cognitive load. Navigation should be self-evident, with the current location always clear and next actions obvious. The tool should feel like a natural extension of the teaching workflow, not a separate system to master.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

**Two-Mode Navigation:** Users toggle between "Library View" (conceptual hierarchy: browse by discipline/unit) and "Calendar View" (chronological sequence: pacing guide order). The active mode is always visually indicated, and switching between modes preserves context (switching from Lesson 8.1.3 in Library View opens Lesson 8.1.3 in Calendar View).

**Lesson Page Consistency:** Every lesson page follows identical section ordering and structure, creating predictable scanning patterns. Sections can be collapsed/expanded, but order never changes. Empty sections are visible but clearly marked as "Not yet added," encouraging completion while showing progress.

**Quick Navigation:** From any lesson page, users can jump to related lessons (previous/next in sequence, related lessons in other units) with single-click actions. Breadcrumb navigation shows current location in hierarchy and provides instant jump-back capability.

**Inline Editing:** All content is editable in place—click any section to edit, changes save automatically. No separate "edit mode" or form views. This supports quick updates during planning without mode switching.

## Core Screens and Views

**Home/Dashboard Screen:** Provides immediate access to both navigation modes (Library and Calendar entry points), displays recently accessed lessons, shows upcoming lessons based on pacing guide, and provides global search bar. Shows high-level content coverage status (how many lessons are fully populated vs. incomplete).

**Library View (Conceptual Navigation):** Three-panel layout showing Discipline list (left), Unit list for selected discipline (middle), and Lesson list for selected unit (right). Selecting a lesson navigates to the Lesson Detail Page. Visual indicators show content completeness for each item.

**Calendar View (Chronological Navigation):** Linear timeline or calendar grid showing teaching sequence. Each lesson is numbered sequentially (Day 1, Day 2, etc.) with lesson title displayed. Current date or teaching position is clearly highlighted. Clicking any lesson opens the Lesson Detail Page.

**Lesson Detail Page:** Single-page view with all lesson sections displayed vertically in consistent order: Lesson Title/Name, Standards, Learning Objectives, Student-Friendly Goals ("We are learning to"), Teaching Approach/Methodology, Resources (with embedded file viewers or download links), and Related Lessons. Navigation controls (Previous Lesson, Next Lesson, Back to Library/Calendar) are always visible. Lesson position within unit and overall sequence is shown.

**Add New Lesson Page:** Simple form pre-populated with template structure. User fills in Discipline, Unit, Lesson Name, and optionally completes other sections. "Save and View" creates the lesson page immediately. Alternatively, "Save and Add Another" creates the lesson and clears form for rapid entry.

**Search Results Page:** List of matching lessons with context snippets showing where search term appears (in lesson name, standard, objective). Results are grouped by Discipline/Unit for context. Clicking any result navigates to that Lesson Detail Page.

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

The system shall meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards including:

- Sufficient color contrast for all text (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- Keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements with visible focus indicators
- Semantic HTML structure with proper heading hierarchy and ARIA labels where needed
- Alt text for any informational images or icons
- Responsive text sizing supporting browser zoom to 200% without loss of functionality
- Form inputs with associated labels and clear error messaging

## Branding

The UI should convey professional educational context with clean, modern aesthetics. Visual design should avoid playful or consumer-app styling—this is a professional tool for educators. Specific branding elements to be determined based on user's preferred UI stack example, but general guidance includes:

- Clean, sans-serif typography for readability
- Generous whitespace and clear visual hierarchy
- Color palette emphasizing neutrals with accent color for interactive elements
- Professional iconography (simple, clear, recognizable)
- Consistent spacing and alignment throughout

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Primary platform is web-based application accessible via desktop and tablet browsers. Responsive design supports minimum viewport width of 768px (tablet landscape). The application prioritizes desktop/laptop usage during planning sessions but should degrade gracefully on tablets. Mobile phone support (viewports <768px) is not required for MVP—this is a planning tool used at desks, not on-the-go. Target browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (current versions and up to 2 years prior).

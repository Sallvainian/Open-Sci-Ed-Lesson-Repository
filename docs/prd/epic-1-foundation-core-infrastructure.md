# Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure

**Epic Goal:** Establish the technical foundation for the project with repository setup, database initialization, basic authentication, CI/CD pipeline, hosting configuration, and a minimal deployed landing page confirming infrastructure is functional. This epic delivers project scaffolding and core services while demonstrating end-to-end deployment capability.

## Story 1.1: Project Repository Initialization

As a developer,
I want the project repository initialized with proper structure, tooling, and initial configuration,
so that development can proceed with consistent standards and all team members (future) have a clear starting point.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Git repository created with appropriate .gitignore for chosen tech stack
2. Monorepo structure established with clear separation between frontend and backend workspaces
3. Package manager configuration (npm/yarn workspaces or equivalent) implemented and functional
4. README.md created with project overview, setup instructions, and basic architecture diagram
5. Development tooling configured: ESLint, Prettier, pre-commit hooks for linting and formatting
6. Environment variable template files created (.env.example) for local development configuration
7. Basic project documentation structure created in /docs directory
8. All configuration files committed and repository ready for first development work

## Story 1.2: Database Setup and Schema Foundation

As a developer,
I want the database system configured with initial schema for core entities,
so that data persistence is available for content storage and the basic data model is validated.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Database system selected and documented in README (PostgreSQL or SQLite based on hosting choice)
2. Database connection configuration implemented with environment variable support
3. Migration system initialized (e.g., Knex.js, Prisma, or similar) for schema version control
4. Initial migration created with tables for Disciplines, Units, Lessons with proper relationships
5. Database includes basic fields: id, name, timestamps (created_at, updated_at)
6. Foreign key constraints properly set up between tables (Unit → Discipline, Lesson → Unit)
7. Local database can be initialized with single command (npm run db:setup or equivalent)
8. Database connection tested via simple CLI script or test that confirms connectivity and basic CRUD operations

## Story 1.3: Backend API Foundation

As a developer,
I want a basic backend API server configured with health check endpoint,
so that the backend infrastructure is operational and deployable for further feature development.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Backend framework initialized (Node.js/Express, Python/FastAPI, or chosen framework)
2. Server starts successfully on configurable port via environment variable
3. Health check endpoint implemented (GET /api/health) returning JSON: {"status": "ok", "timestamp": "<ISO-datetime>"}
4. CORS configuration implemented for local frontend development
5. Basic error handling middleware implemented for catching and logging server errors
6. Request logging middleware added for debugging (logs method, path, status code, response time)
7. Server can be started locally with single command (npm run dev:backend or equivalent)
8. Health check endpoint successfully returns 200 OK when server is running

## Story 1.4: Frontend Application Foundation

As a developer,
I want the frontend application initialized with routing and basic layout,
so that the UI framework is operational and ready for feature implementation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Frontend framework initialized based on user's preferred tech stack (React, Vue, or similar)
2. Development server starts successfully with hot-reloading enabled
3. Basic routing configured with at least home route (/)
4. Base application layout component created with header, main content area, and footer placeholders
5. Global styling foundation established (CSS reset, base typography, color variables)
6. API client utility configured for making requests to backend with error handling
7. Environment variable support for API base URL (allows different backends for dev/staging/prod)
8. Frontend can be started locally with single command (npm run dev:frontend or equivalent)
9. Application renders successfully in browser at localhost with "Welcome" or placeholder content

## Story 1.5: Basic Authentication Implementation

As a user,
I want to log in to the application with username and password,
so that my lesson content is protected and only accessible to me.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Login page created with username/password form fields
2. Backend endpoint implemented: POST /api/auth/login accepting username/password
3. Password securely hashed and validated against stored credential (single hardcoded user acceptable for MVP)
4. Authentication successful returns JWT token or session ID with appropriate expiration (8 hours)
5. Frontend stores authentication token securely (httpOnly cookie or localStorage with appropriate security)
6. Protected API routes require valid authentication token; return 401 Unauthorized if missing or invalid
7. Frontend redirects unauthenticated users to login page when accessing protected routes
8. Logout functionality implemented clearing authentication token (endpoint: POST /api/auth/logout)
9. User remains authenticated across browser refresh for duration of token validity
10. Login with correct credentials grants access; incorrect credentials return clear error message

## Story 1.6: CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

As a developer,
I want automated CI/CD pipeline that runs tests and deploys to production,
so that code changes are validated automatically and deployments are consistent and reliable.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. CI/CD platform configured (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or chosen platform)
2. CI pipeline runs on every push to main branch and all pull requests
3. CI pipeline executes: linting (ESLint), formatting check (Prettier), unit tests (if any exist yet)
4. CI pipeline blocks merge if any checks fail
5. CD pipeline triggers automatic deployment to hosting platform on successful main branch merge
6. Deployment includes both frontend and backend components
7. Environment variables for production configured in hosting platform (not exposed in repository)
8. Deployment status visible in repository (GitHub commit status, badges, or similar)
9. Failed deployments send notification or alert (email, Slack, or platform notification)
10. Deployment process documented in README with manual rollback procedure

## Story 1.7: Hosting and Production Environment Setup

As a user,
I want the application deployed to a publicly accessible URL,
so that I can access my lesson planning tool from any internet-connected device.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Hosting platform selected and configured (Vercel, Netlify, Railway, Render, or similar)
2. Database hosted on platform supporting provider or separate database hosting service (e.g., Railway PostgreSQL, Supabase, PlanetScale)
3. Production environment variables configured securely on hosting platform (database URL, auth secret, etc.)

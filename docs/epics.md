## Epic Overview

This document provides detailed user story breakdowns for all four epics of the OpenSciEd Lesson Repository MVP. Each epic is broken into individual user stories with acceptance criteria, prerequisites, and technical notes. Stories are sized using Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13) based on complexity and effort.

**Implementation Strategy**: Sequential epic completion (Epic 1 → 2 → 3 → 4) with some parallelization opportunities within epics.

**Story Point Legend**:
- **1 point**: Trivial, <2 hours
- **2 points**: Simple, 2-4 hours
- **3 points**: Straightforward, 4-8 hours
- **5 points**: Moderate, 1-2 days
- **8 points**: Complex, 2-3 days
- **13 points**: Very complex, 3-5 days

1. Lesson JSON restructured to identify discrete sections:
   - Objectives section (with unique ID)
   - Materials section (with unique ID)
   - Each phase of lesson sequence (engage, explore, etc.) as separate objects
   - Teaching notes by section
   - Resources by section
2. Each section includes:
   - `id`: unique identifier
   - `type`: section type (objectives, materials, phase, notes, resources)
   - `order`: display sequence number
   - `content`: section-specific data
   - `optional`: boolean (can be hidden in custom lessons)
3. Sections can be rendered independently by frontend components
4. Section order can be changed without breaking functionality
5. Sections can be filtered by audience tag (teacher/student/both)
6. Schema migration script created for existing data
7. Backward compatibility maintained during transition

**Technical Notes**:
- This is architectural refactoring, not user-visible change
- Design with custom lesson builder in mind (Phase 2 feature)
- Consider using section templates for different lesson types
- Document section schema for future data extraction
- Validate that all existing lessons can be migrated

### Story 4.2: Add Audience Tagging to Lesson Content

**As a** developer
**I want** lesson content tagged by intended audience (teacher/student/both)
**So that** we can filter content for student-facing views in Phase 3

**Prerequisites**:
- Lesson data schema refactored (Story 4.1)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Each lesson section includes `audience` field:
   - `teacher`: visible only in teacher view
   - `student`: visible in both teacher and student views
   - `both`: visible in both views (default)
2. Audience tags applied to all content types:
   - Objectives: typically "both"
   - Materials: typically "both"
   - Lesson sequence: typically "both"
   - Teaching notes: typically "teacher"
   - Assessment guidance: typically "teacher"
   - Student worksheets: typically "both"
3. Frontend components respect audience tags (even if only teacher view exists in MVP)
4. Data extraction guidelines updated to include audience tagging
5. Existing lesson data migrated with appropriate audience tags
6. Schema validation enforces audience field presence

**Technical Notes**:
- Default to "both" if audience tag missing (safest)
- Consider more granular tags in future (admin, parent, etc.)
- Document audience tagging guidelines for data creators
- This enables Epic 5 (future) for student-facing interface

### Story 4.3: Implement State Management Abstraction Layer

**As a** developer
**I want** a clean state management architecture
**So that** we can add user preferences, tracking, and auth without refactoring

**Prerequisites**:
- Core application functional (Epic 1 & 2)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. State management library selected and configured:
   - Options: React Context + Hooks, Zustand, Redux Toolkit, Jotai
   - Decision documented in technical-decisions.md
2. Abstraction layer created for:
   - UI state (navigation, modals, etc.)
   - User preferences (last viewed lesson, etc.)
   - Future: user authentication state
   - Future: lesson tracking/notes state
3. LocalStorage wrapper implemented:
   - Save/load user preferences
   - Versioning for localStorage schema
   - Migration support for localStorage changes
4. State hooks/selectors created for components to consume
5. No direct localStorage access in components (use abstraction)
6. Documentation for adding new state slices

**Technical Notes**:
- For MVP, Context + Hooks may be sufficient
- Design for future server-side state (user accounts)
- Consider using Zustand for simplicity and performance
- Separate client-side state from server-synced state (future)

### Story 4.4: Create Component Props for View Mode Support

**As a** developer
**I want** components that accept view mode parameter (teacher/student)
**So that** we can render different views without rewriting components

**Prerequisites**:
- Audience tagging implemented (Story 4.2)
- All content components built (Epic 2)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Core components updated to accept `viewMode` prop:
   - `LessonDetail` component
   - `LessonSection` component
   - `ResourceLinks` component
   - Any other content components
2. Component filters content based on viewMode and audience tags:
   - viewMode="teacher": show all content
   - viewMode="student": hide "teacher" tagged content
3. No visual changes in MVP (always uses "teacher" view)
4. Props documented with TypeScript types
5. Component tests include both view modes
6. Storybook stories (if used) demonstrate both modes

**Technical Notes**:
- This is architectural preparation, not user-visible feature
- MVP always passes viewMode="teacher"
- Phase 3 will introduce student view with viewMode="student"
- Consider using React Context to avoid prop drilling

### Story 4.5: Design Authentication-Ready Routing Structure

**As a** developer
**I want** routing architecture that supports protected routes
**So that** we can add authentication in Phase 2 without major refactoring

**Prerequisites**:
- Client-side routing implemented (Story 1.2)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Route structure defined for future auth:
   - Public routes: home, public lesson view (future)
   - Protected routes: teacher dashboard, custom lessons (future)
   - Auth routes: login, register, forgot password (future)
2. Higher-order component or hook created for route protection:
   - `ProtectedRoute` wrapper component OR
   - `useAuth` hook for checking authentication
3. MVP: all routes public (no actual protection)
4. Auth state management pattern defined (even if not implemented)
5. Redirect logic planned for unauthenticated users
6. Documentation for adding auth in Phase 2

**Technical Notes**:
- Use Next.js middleware or React Router loaders for auth checks
- Design for multiple auth providers (email/password, Google, etc.)
- Consider using NextAuth.js or Clerk for future implementation
- This is planning/architecture, not active authentication

**Story Points**: 2

### Story 4.6: Document Architecture Decisions and Extension Patterns

**As a** future developer (or future Frank)
**I want** clear documentation of architectural decisions
**So that** I understand how to extend the system without breaking it

**Prerequisites**:
- All Epic 4 architectural work completed (Stories 4.1-4.5)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) created for:
   - Data schema design (modular sections)
   - State management approach
   - Routing and authentication strategy
   - Audience tagging system
   - View mode architecture
2. Extension guides written for:
   - Adding new lesson sections
   - Implementing custom lesson builder
   - Adding user authentication
   - Creating student-facing view
   - Integrating third-party services
3. Data schema documented with examples:
   - JSON structure with comments
   - TypeScript interfaces
   - Schema validation rules
4. Component architecture diagram created
5. Future roadmap documented (Phase 2 and 3 plans)
6. Documentation stored in `/docs` directory

**Technical Notes**:
- Use ADR format (Context, Decision, Consequences)
- Include code examples in extension guides
- Document "why" decisions were made, not just "what"
- Update documentation as architecture evolves
- Consider using Docusaurus or similar for doc site (future)

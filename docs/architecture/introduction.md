# Introduction

## Purpose

This document defines the complete technical architecture for the **Open Science Education Lesson Repository**, a web-based lesson planning workflow tool designed to organize OpenSciEd science curriculum materials. The system enables early-career science teachers to quickly find lesson content, teaching approaches, standards, objectives, and resources in under 30 seconds.

## Architectural Goals

- **Single-User Optimization**: Personal planning tool for individual teacher workflow
- **Fast Material Retrieval**: <30 second target for finding complete lesson materials
- **Cost-Effective Hosting**: Target <$20/month operational costs
- **Content Organization Focus**: 90% organization, 10% creation
- **Professional Educational Design**: Calm, reference library aesthetic
- **Dual Navigation Support**: Both conceptual (Discipline→Unit→Lesson) and chronological (pacing guide) access patterns

## Key Success Metrics

- Navigation clicks to target lesson: ≤3 clicks
- Page load time: <3 seconds
- File viewer loading: <2 seconds for documents up to 10MB
- Search results: <1 second
- System uptime: 99.9% during school hours (7am-5pm local time)

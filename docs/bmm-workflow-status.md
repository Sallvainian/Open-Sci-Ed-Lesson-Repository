## Implementation Progress (Phase 4 Only)

### Current Sprint

**IN PROGRESS:**
- **Story 1.1:** Define JSON Data Schema and Structure (5 points)
  - Status: Ready for development
  - File: `stories/story-1.1.md`
  - Context: `stories/story-context-1.1.xml` ✓

**TODO:** Story 1.2 (next in Epic 1)
**DONE:** 0 stories (0 points)

### Backlog Summary
**Total Remaining:** 27 stories (63 points) across 4 epics

---

## What to do next:

**⭐ RECOMMENDED NEXT ACTION:** Implement Story 1.1

**Story Ready for Implementation:**
- Story 1.1: Define JSON Data Schema and Structure (5 points)
- Status: Ready with complete context
- Context file: `stories/story-context-1.1.xml` ✓

**Command to run:** Load DEV agent and run `*dev-story` workflow
- Context XML provides comprehensive implementation guidance
- Includes PRD requirements, architecture patterns, constraints, and testing standards

**What DEV Agent Will Implement:**
1. TypeScript type definitions (`lib/types/lesson.ts`)
2. JSON data files (disciplines, units, sample lessons)
3. Data loader utilities (`lib/data/loader.ts`)
4. Zod validation script (`scripts/validate-data.ts`)
5. Package.json scripts and pre-build hooks

**Implementation Guidance:**
- Follow TypeScript strict mode
- Audience tagging for future student views (FR-12)
- Static Site Generation compatible (Next.js 15)
- Validation runs before every build

## Project Notes

- **Multi-Platform Strategy:** Starting with web MVP, planning mobile and desktop expansion
- **UI Components:** Yes - UX workflow will be included in Phase 2
- **Analysis Approach:** Full analysis phase selected for thorough requirements discovery
- **Level Determination:** Deferred to Phase 2 (plan-project workflow)

## Workflow History

- **2025-10-13:** Initial workflow planning completed, status file created
- **2025-10-13:** Completed product-brief workflow via voice mode conversation. Product Brief document generated covering problem statement, solution vision, target users, MVP scope, and strategic alignment. Next: Proceed to plan-project workflow to create PRD.
- **2025-10-13:** Completed plan-project workflow via voice mode conversation. Determined project as Level 3 (full product with architectural planning). Generated comprehensive PRD (1,395 lines) with 15 functional requirements, 12 non-functional requirements, 3 detailed user journeys, 10 UX principles, and 4-epic structure. Created detailed epic breakdown document (epics.md, 850+ lines) with 28 user stories across 4 epics (68 story points total). Phase 2 Planning is 66% complete. Next: UX Specification workflow recommended before proceeding to Architecture phase.
- **2025-10-13:** Completed ux-spec workflow via voice mode conversation. Generated comprehensive UX Specification (2,229 lines) covering all design aspects: project overview with dashboard landing page (Pick Up Where Left Off, Coming Soon cards, Recently Viewed, Browse by Discipline), 3 user personas, 6 usability goals, 10 design principles, complete information architecture with site map and URL structure, 5 detailed user flows with Mermaid diagrams, component library recommendation (shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS), 14 core component specifications, complete visual design foundation (dark mode color palette, Inter typography, spacing system), responsive design patterns for desktop/tablet/mobile, WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility requirements, animation and motion specifications, 3 ASCII wireframes for key screens. Also created AI Frontend Generation Prompt document (ai-frontend-prompt.md) with complete technical specifications for v0.dev/Lovable AI including TypeScript schemas, Tailwind configuration, 5 screen implementations with component code, localStorage patterns, accessibility implementation, error handling, testing checklist, and 5-sprint implementation plan. Phase 2 Planning is now 100% complete. Next: Solution Architecture workflow (Phase 3 Solutioning).
- **2025-10-14:** Created Story 1.1 (Define JSON Data Schema and Structure) and marked ready for development. Story includes TypeScript type definitions, JSON data structure, data loader utilities, and Zod validation script. Status updated to IN PROGRESS. Next: Generate story context XML with *story-context workflow.
- **2025-10-14:** Completed story-context for Story 1.1 (Define JSON Data Schema and Structure). Context file: stories/story-context-1.1.xml. Context includes relevant PRD requirements (FR-5, FR-12), solution architecture guidance, tech spec implementation details, constraints, interfaces, and testing standards. Next: DEV agent should run dev-story to implement.

## Description, Context and Goals

### Project Description

The OpenSciEd Lesson Repository is a comprehensive web application that transforms the OpenSciEd middle school science curriculum from unwieldy PDF files into a structured, searchable, and easily navigable digital platform. The system addresses the critical daily challenge faced by science teachers who waste 20-30 minutes per lesson searching through massive PDF documents stored in Google Drive to extract learning objectives, materials lists, and teaching guidance.

The platform provides instant access to all lesson components through intuitive hierarchical navigation (Discipline → Unit → Lesson), displaying all essential information on a single page: student-facing learning objectives (WALTs), complete materials lists, teaching guidance, and linked resources. Built with a modern dark mode interface for evening planning sessions, the MVP targets personal use with a clear path to scale for colleagues, departments, and eventually student access.

The architecture is designed for future expansion to include student-facing views (filtered to show only relevant assignment materials), custom lesson building capabilities (cherry-picking sections within lessons), and multi-platform deployment (mobile and desktop applications). This Level 3 project requires comprehensive architectural planning to support these planned subsystems while delivering immediate value through a focused MVP.

### Deployment Intent

**MVP Deployment (Phase 1 - Personal Use)**:
- Single-user web application deployed to free-tier static hosting (Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages)
- Accessible via modern web browsers on laptop and tablet devices
- No authentication or user management required for MVP
- Static JSON data structure with pre-processed curriculum content
- Target deployment: 2-4 weeks from development start

**Phase 2 Deployment (Colleague Expansion)**:
- Multi-user capability with basic authentication
- Shared access for department colleagues (2-5 users)
- Potential for custom lesson sharing between users
- Upgraded hosting to support concurrent users
- Timeline: 3-6 months post-MVP validation

**Phase 3 Deployment (Student Access)**:
- Dual-interface system: Teacher view and Student view
- Student-facing interface with filtered content (objectives and assignments only)
- Assignment tracking and progress monitoring capabilities
- Integration with potential school LMS systems
- Timeline: 6-12 months post-MVP, contingent on colleague adoption success

**Long-term Vision (Platform Deployment)**:
- Native mobile applications (iOS/Android) for on-the-go access
- Desktop applications with offline capability
- Potential expansion to other open curricula beyond OpenSciEd
- District-wide deployment with SSO integration
- Timeline: 1-2 years, contingent on market validation

### Context

**Problem Statement:**
New and early-career middle school science teachers using the OpenSciEd curriculum face a daily workflow crisis. The curriculum—recognized for its high-quality, three-dimensional science learning approach—exists only as massive PDF files stored in Google Drive. Teachers spend 20-30 minutes per lesson hunting through dense documents to find learning objectives, materials lists, and teaching guidance, resulting in preparation anxiety, wasted time, and reduced confidence in lesson delivery.

This inefficiency stems from a fundamental mismatch between the storage format (static PDFs optimized for printing) and the use case (quick digital reference during planning). Generic file management solutions like Google Drive provide no curriculum-specific structure, and PDF format prevents efficient scanning, filtering, or selective information extraction. Every evening, teachers face the same friction: knowing what needs to be taught tomorrow but lacking quick access to the structured information required to feel prepared and confident.

**Why Now:**
- Frank (primary user) is currently teaching using OpenSciEd curriculum and experiencing this pain daily
- Immediate time savings and stress reduction available upon MVP deployment
- Recent advances in web technologies enable rapid development of responsive, dark-mode interfaces
- AI-assisted development makes solo implementation feasible within reasonable timeline
- Early adoption success can demonstrate value to colleagues before expanding scope
- Academic calendar creates natural validation period: deploy before next semester for maximum impact

**Strategic Opportunity:**
Beyond personal productivity, this tool addresses a broader market need. Thousands of teachers nationally use OpenSciEd curriculum, and the number is growing as districts adopt high-quality open science materials. A validated solution could scale to serve the broader OpenSciEd teacher community, potentially partnering with the OpenSciEd organization itself. The platform's architecture can extend to other open curricula (ELA, Math, Social Studies), creating a universal lesson planning platform. Success with this focused MVP establishes both technical proof-of-concept and user validation for future product expansion.

_Note: Detailed user stories with acceptance criteria for each epic are documented in epics.md_

## Out of Scope

The following features and capabilities are explicitly excluded from MVP scope but documented for future consideration:

###  **Out of Scope for MVP - Deferred to Phase 2**

1. **Custom Lesson Builder** (Top Priority for v2.0)
   - Select specific sections within lessons
   - Reorder or hide lesson components
   - Save custom lesson versions
   - Create personal lesson library
   - **Rationale**: Requires complex state management and data model. MVP validates core navigation first.

2. **User Accounts and Authentication**
   - User registration and login
   - Personal profiles
   - Password management
   - **Rationale**: Not needed for single-user MVP. Essential for Phase 2 colleague expansion.

3. **Search Functionality**
   - Full-text search across lessons
   - Search by standard, objective, or material
   - Filter and sort capabilities
   - **Rationale**: Hierarchical navigation sufficient for MVP. Search adds complexity without validating core value.

4. **Lesson Tracking and Progress**
   - Mark lessons as taught/planned/upcoming
   - Track when lessons were last taught
   - Planning calendar view
   - **Rationale**: Nice-to-have feature that requires user state management. Not essential for MVP value.

5. **Personal Notes and Annotations**
   - Add teaching notes to lessons
   - Track modifications made
   - Save successful adaptations
   - **Rationale**: Requires user-specific data storage. Valuable but not critical for MVP validation.

### Out of Scope for Phase 1-2 - Deferred to Phase 3

6. **Student-Facing Interface**
   - Student login and access
   - Filtered content view (objectives and assignments only)
   - Assignment submission
   - Progress tracking for students
   - **Rationale**: Requires teacher validation and colleague adoption first. Major architectural expansion.

7. **Collaboration Features**
   - Share custom lessons with colleagues
   - Department-wide lesson libraries
   - Comments and discussion threads
   - Co-editing capabilities
   - **Rationale**: Requires multi-user infrastructure and social features. Not needed until colleague adoption proven.

### Out of Scope for All Phases - Not Planned

8. **PDF Extraction and Processing Automation**
   - Automated curriculum data extraction from PDFs
   - OCR or parsing tools
   - **Rationale**: Frank provides structured data manually. Automation is complex and not essential to value proposition.

9. **Content Management System (CMS)**
   - In-app content editing
   - Curriculum authoring tools
   - Version control for curriculum
   - **Rationale**: Content updates happen in source data files, not through application UI.

10. **Integration with School LMS**
    - Canvas, Google Classroom, Schoology integration
    - Grade passback
    - Assignment synchronization
    - **Rationale**: MVP is standalone tool. LMS integration adds complexity without validating core value.

11. **Mobile Native Applications**
    - iOS app
    - Android app
    - **Rationale**: Responsive web app sufficient for MVP and Phase 2. Native apps require significant development investment.

12. **Offline-First Capabilities**
    - Service workers for offline access
    - Sync when connection restored
    - Download lessons for offline use
    - **Rationale**: Internet access assumed for MVP. Offline capability is enhancement, not requirement.

13. **Analytics and Usage Tracking**
    - Detailed usage analytics
    - Teacher behavior patterns
    - Feature usage statistics
    - **Rationale**: Privacy-first approach for MVP. Basic logging sufficient for initial validation.

14. **Content Expansion Beyond OpenSciEd**
    - Support for other curricula
    - Cross-curricular lesson planning
    - Universal lesson repository
    - **Rationale**: OpenSciEd validation required first. Expansion is long-term opportunity, not MVP need.

## Assumptions and Dependencies

### Key Assumptions

**User Behavior Assumptions**:
- Teachers will adopt digital tool over PDF workflow if it delivers 50%+ time savings
- Evening planning sessions (7-10 PM) are primary use case, not in-class reference
- Hierarchical navigation (Discipline → Unit → Lesson) matches teachers' mental model
- Dark mode interface is preferred for evening use and reduces eye strain
- Teachers value speed and simplicity over feature richness in MVP

**Technical Assumptions**:
- Static site generation with JSON data is sufficient for performance needs
- JSON data structure can scale to full OpenSciEd curriculum (150-200 lessons) without performance degradation
- Modern web browsers (last 2 versions) are available on teacher devices
- Free-tier static hosting (Vercel/Netlify) provides adequate reliability and performance
- Internet connectivity is available during planning sessions

**Content Assumptions**:
- OpenSciEd curriculum structure is stable enough to build against
- Manual data extraction from PDFs is feasible for all needed lessons (3-5 units for MVP)
- Resources (PDFs, PowerPoints) can be legally hosted or linked
- Curriculum updates from OpenSciEd are infrequent enough to maintain manually (<1 per semester)

**Market Assumptions**:
- Other OpenSciEd teachers face similar lesson planning challenges
- Colleagues will be interested in tool if Frank validates its value through consistent use
- There is broader market potential for curriculum-specific planning tools
- Personal productivity gains justify development investment even without scaling

### Dependencies

**Data Dependencies**:
- **Frank provides structured curriculum data**: Manual extraction from OpenSciEd PDFs for 3-5 initial units (Life, Earth, Physical Science)
- **Data completeness validation**: All extracted lessons must include objectives, materials, sequence, notes, and resource links
- **Resource file availability**: PDFs and PowerPoints must be accessible for linking (Google Drive or self-hosted)

**Technical Dependencies**:
- **React/Next.js ecosystem**: Modern React framework with static site generation capabilities
- **Hosting platform**: Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages for free-tier static hosting
- **Development tools**: Node.js, npm/yarn, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier
- **UI component library**: Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui (or similar) for consistent styling

**External Dependencies**:
- **OpenSciEd curriculum licensing**: Verify that hosting curriculum content is legally acceptable (likely Creative Commons or similar open license)
- **Browser compatibility**: Modern browsers with JavaScript enabled
- **Internet connectivity**: Required for web application access (no offline mode in MVP)

### Risks and Mitigation Strategies

**High-Risk Items**:
1. **Data Extraction Burden** (High Impact, Medium Probability)
   - **Risk**: Manual data extraction takes longer than expected, delaying MVP
   - **Mitigation**: Start with 3 units only (one per discipline), validate process, scale gradually
   - **Contingency**: Use single discipline (Physical Science) for initial validation

2. **Adoption Resistance** (Medium Impact, Medium Probability)
   - **Risk**: Frank reverts to PDF workflow despite tool availability
   - **Mitigation**: Make tool dramatically faster (not just slightly better), focus on daily use case
   - **Contingency**: Iterate on UX based on actual usage friction points

3. **Performance Degradation at Scale** (High Impact, Low Probability)
   - **Risk**: JSON approach doesn't scale to full curriculum, requires database refactoring
   - **Mitigation**: Test with larger dataset early, optimize data loading patterns
   - **Contingency**: Implement lazy loading or pagination strategies

**Medium-Risk Items**:
4. **Copyright/Licensing Issues** (High Impact, Low Probability)
   - **Risk**: Hosting OpenSciEd content violates terms of use
   - **Mitigation**: Research OpenSciEd licensing early, contact organization if unclear
   - **Contingency**: Link to official OpenSciEd resources instead of self-hosting

5. **Browser Compatibility Problems** (Low Impact, Medium Probability)
   - **Risk**: Tool doesn't work on school-issued devices
   - **Mitigation**: Test on multiple browsers early, use standard web technologies
   - **Contingency**: Provide browser compatibility documentation

6. **Colleague Disinterest** (Low Impact, Medium Probability)
   - **Risk**: No colleague interest means no Phase 2 expansion
   - **Mitigation**: Design for broader use case from start, validate value thoroughly
   - **Contingency**: Tool remains valuable as personal productivity app

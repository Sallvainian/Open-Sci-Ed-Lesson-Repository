---

## 5. Story Readiness Assessment

### Ready for Implementation (26/28 stories)

**Epic 1**: ✅ All 7 stories ready
**Epic 2**: ✅ All 8 stories ready
**Epic 3**: ✅ All 7 stories ready
**Epic 4**: ⚠️ 4/6 stories ready, 2 need architectural detail

### Stories Requiring Additional Architecture Detail (2/28)

**Story 4.1: Refactor Lesson Data Schema for Modular Sections**
- **Current State**: Lesson types exist, but section boundaries not explicitly defined
- **Gap**: No `id`, `type`, `order`, `optional` fields specified in section schema
- **Impact**: Custom lesson builder (Phase 2) may require schema refactoring
- **Recommendation**: Add section metadata to Lesson type definition

**Story 4.2: Add Audience Tagging to Lesson Content**
- **Current State**: No audience field in any type definitions
- **Gap**: Missing `audience: "teacher" | "student" | "both"` in schema
- **Impact**: Student-facing view (Phase 3) will require schema changes
- **Recommendation**: Add audience field to LessonPhase, TeachingGuidance, Resource types

---

## 6. Critical Issues and Recommendations

### Critical Issues (1)

**🔴 CRITICAL-1: Missing Audience Tagging in Data Model**

- **Issue**: FR-12 (Student-Facing View) requires audience tagging, but TypeScript types in §3.1 lack `audience` field
- **Impact**: Phase 3 student view will require breaking schema changes
- **Severity**: HIGH (affects future architecture)
- **Recommendation**:
  ```typescript
  // Add to all relevant types:
  audience?: "teacher" | "student" | "both"  // Default: "both"
  ```
- **Files to Update**:
  - §3.1 TypeScript Type Definitions
  - §2.4 Example Lesson JSON Schema
- **Effort**: 15 minutes

### Important Issues (2)

**🟡 IMPORTANT-1: Section Schema Not Fully Specified for Modular Architecture**

- **Issue**: Story 4.1 requires section-based schema, but current Lesson type doesn't include section metadata
- **Impact**: Custom lesson builder may require refactoring
- **Severity**: MEDIUM
- **Recommendation**: Add section metadata wrapper:
  ```typescript
  interface LessonSection {
    id: string
    type: "objectives" | "materials" | "phase" | "notes" | "resources"
    order: number
    optional: boolean
    audience: "teacher" | "student" | "both"
    content: LessonPhase | LessonMaterial[] | string[] | TeachingGuidance | Resource[]
  }
  ```
- **Effort**: 30 minutes

**🟡 IMPORTANT-2: Testing Library Versions Not Specified**

- **Issue**: Vitest and Playwright listed as "Latest" instead of major version
- **Impact**: Build reproducibility, breaking changes risk
- **Severity**: LOW-MEDIUM
- **Recommendation**: Specify major versions:
  - Vitest: `2.x` (or `1.x` if stability preferred)
  - Playwright: `1.x`
- **Effort**: 5 minutes

### Nice-to-Have Enhancements (3)

**🟢 ENHANCEMENT-1: Add Performance Budget Table**
- Add specific bundle size targets to §5 Performance Optimization
- Example: Initial JS <200KB, CSS <50KB, LCP <1.5s, TTI <3.5s

**🟢 ENHANCEMENT-2: Expand Adapter Pattern Example**
- Show complete interface implementation for both LocalStorageAdapter and SupabaseAdapter
- Demonstrate migration path more concretely

**🟢 ENHANCEMENT-3: Add Testing Strategy Matrix**
- Map test types (unit, integration, E2E, a11y) to specific components
- Example: ObjectivesCard → unit test, Navigation flow → E2E test

## 7. Code vs Design Balance Analysis

### Over-Specification Check (>10 lines of code)

**Scanned for code blocks in architecture:**

| Section | Code Block | Lines | Type | Assessment |
|---------|-----------|-------|------|------------|
| §2.4 | Example Lesson JSON | ~40 | Example data | ✅ ACCEPTABLE (schema example) |
| §3.1 | TypeScript Types | ~60 | Type definitions | ✅ ACCEPTABLE (interface specs) |
| §3.2 | LocalStorage Functions | ~20 | Implementation | ⚠️ BORDERLINE (could be pseudocode) |
| §3.3 | Adapter Pattern | ~25 | Implementation | ⚠️ BORDERLINE (interface design) |
| §4.1 | AppContext | ~15 | Implementation | ⚠️ BORDERLINE (pattern example) |
| §5.2 | Image Optimization | 3 | API usage | ✅ ACCEPTABLE |
| §7.1 | Unit Test Example | ~10 | Test example | ✅ ACCEPTABLE |
| §7.2 | E2E Test Example | ~15 | Test example | ✅ ACCEPTABLE |

**Design Focus Score**: 85% (Excellent)
**Implementation Code**: 15% (Acceptable for Level 3 architecture)

**Assessment**: ✅ **PASS** - Architecture maintains design focus. Code samples are illustrative examples showing patterns, not prescriptive implementations.

**Recommendation**: Consider moving §3.2 localStorage functions to pseudocode or flowchart in tech specs.

2. Section schema not fully specified (important for Phase 2)
3. Minor version ambiguity in testing libraries

**Overall Assessment**: ✅ **Architecture is production-ready for Epic 1-3 implementation**

---

## 9. Recommendations

### Before Proceeding to Tech Specs (Required)

**✅ Must Fix (Critical)**:
1. Add `audience` field to TypeScript types (§3.1)
2. Update example JSON schema with audience tags (§2.4)

**⏱️ Estimated Time**: 20 minutes

### During Tech Spec Generation (Important)

**🟡 Should Address**:
1. Define section-based schema wrapper for Story 4.1
2. Specify major versions for Vitest and Playwright
3. Add ViewMode prop specifications to component architecture

**⏱️ Estimated Time**: 45 minutes

### Future Enhancement (Nice-to-Have)

**🟢 Consider for Tech Specs**:
1. Add performance budget table to epic tech specs
2. Create testing strategy matrix by component
3. Expand adapter pattern with complete implementations

---

## 10. Final Recommendation

### ✅ **PROCEED TO EPIC TECH SPECS** (with minor fixes)

**Rationale**:
- 94.7% readiness score exceeds 90% threshold for Level 3
- Only 1 critical gap (audience tagging) - easily fixed in 20 minutes
- 26/28 stories have complete architectural foundation
- Technology stack is fully specified and justified
- Clear migration path from MVP → Phase 2 → Phase 3

**Next Actions**:
1. **Immediate** (20 min): Add audience tagging to TypeScript types and JSON examples
2. **Tech Specs** (45 min/epic): Generate 4 epic-specific tech specs with section details
3. **Implementation**: Begin Epic 1 development with confidence

**Expected Tech Spec Structure**:
- tech-spec-epic-1.md: Navigation and data infrastructure
- tech-spec-epic-2.md: Content display and resources
- tech-spec-epic-3.md: UX polish and performance
- tech-spec-epic-4.md: Future-ready architecture (with section schema detail)

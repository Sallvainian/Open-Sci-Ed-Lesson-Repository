# Story 1.6: CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** automated CI/CD pipeline that runs tests and deploys to production,
**so that** code changes are validated automatically and deployments are consistent and reliable.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. CI/CD platform configured (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or chosen platform)
2. CI pipeline runs on every push to main branch and all pull requests
3. CI pipeline executes: linting (ESLint), formatting check (Prettier), unit tests (if any exist yet)
4. CI pipeline blocks merge if any checks fail
5. CD pipeline triggers automatic deployment to hosting platform on successful main branch merge
6. Deployment includes both frontend and backend components
7. Environment variables for production configured in hosting platform (not exposed in repository)
8. Deployment status visible in repository (GitHub commit status, badges, or similar)
9. Failed deployments send notification or alert (email, Slack, or platform notification)
10. Deployment process documented in README with manual rollback procedure

### Technology Stack

**CI/CD Platform** [Source: architecture/technology-stack.md]:

- Primary: **GitHub Actions** (built-in to GitHub, free for public repos, generous free tier for private)
- Alternative: GitLab CI (if using GitLab instead of GitHub)
- Deployment Target: **Vercel** (zero-config Next.js deployment, edge functions, CDN)

**Quality Tools** [Source: architecture/technology-stack.md]:

- Linting: **ESLint 8.x** (code quality, Next.js config, accessibility plugins)
- Formatting: **Prettier 3.x** (consistent code style, automatic formatting)
- Type Checking: **TypeScript Compiler 5.x** (static type validation)

- Testing - Component: **React Testing Library 14.x** (user-centric testing)
- Testing - E2E: **Playwright 1.x** (cross-browser testing, reliable, fast)

**Package Manager** [Source: architecture/technology-stack.md]:

- **pnpm 8.x** (fast, efficient, workspace support)
- All CI commands use pnpm (not npm or yarn)

### CI/CD Workflow Architecture

**GitHub Actions CI Workflow** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:

File: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: ['**']

jobs:
  quality-checks:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup pnpm
        uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
        with:
          version: 8

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'pnpm'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

      - name: Run ESLint
        run: pnpm lint

      - name: Check Prettier formatting
        run: pnpm prettier --check .

      - name: TypeScript type check
        run: pnpm type-check

      - name: Run unit tests
        run: pnpm test
```

**GitHub Actions CD Workflow** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md + Vercel Best Practices]:

File: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

```yaml
name: Deploy to Vercel

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup pnpm
        uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
        with:
          version: 8

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'pnpm'

      - name: Install Vercel CLI
        run: npm install --global vercel@latest

      - name: Pull Vercel Environment Information
        run: vercel pull --yes --environment=production --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}

      - name: Build Project Artifacts
        run: vercel build --prod --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}

      - name: Deploy to Vercel
        run: vercel deploy --prebuilt --prod --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
```

**Alternative: Vercel GitHub Integration** (Recommended for Simplicity):

Instead of GitHub Actions CD workflow, use Vercel's native GitHub integration:

- Vercel automatically detects GitHub repository
- Auto-deploys on push to main branch
- Preview deployments for pull requests
- No GitHub Actions CD workflow needed
- Configure via Vercel dashboard → Import Git Repository

**If using Vercel GitHub Integration** (recommended):

- Skip creating `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- Only create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for quality checks
- Vercel handles CD automatically via GitHub integration
- Configure production environment variables in Vercel dashboard
- Deployment status visible on GitHub commits automatically

### Package Scripts

**Available Commands** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint",
    "test": "vitest",
    "test:e2e": "playwright test",
    "type-check": "tsc --noEmit",
    "prettier": "prettier"
  }
}
```

**CI Pipeline Uses**:

- `pnpm lint` → ESLint code quality checks
- `pnpm prettier --check .` → Prettier formatting verification
- `pnpm type-check` → TypeScript compilation validation
- `pnpm test` → Vitest unit and component tests

### Environment Variables Configuration

**Production Environment Variables** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:

Must be configured in Vercel dashboard (Settings → Environment Variables):

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:5432/dbname"

# Authentication
JWT_SECRET="production-secret-key-32-characters-minimum"

# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project.supabase.co"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your-anon-key"
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY="your-service-key"

# Application
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="https://your-app.vercel.app"
NODE_ENV="production"
```

**Security Requirements** [Source: Security Best Practices]:

- Never commit environment variables to repository (already in .gitignore)
- Use `.env.example` for documentation, not actual values
- Production secrets must be different from development secrets
- Vercel environment variables are encrypted and secure

### Deployment Process

**Automatic Deployment Flow** [Source: Vercel Documentation + Best Practices]:

1. Developer pushes code to repository
2. **CI Pipeline Runs** (GitHub Actions):
   - ESLint checks code quality
   - Prettier verifies formatting
   - TypeScript validates types
   - Vitest runs unit tests
   - **If any check fails**: Pipeline fails, blocks merge
3. **After CI passes** (manual merge to main):
   - Vercel detects push to main branch
   - Vercel builds Next.js application (frontend + API routes)
   - Vercel deploys to production edge network
   - Deployment status updates on GitHub commit
4. **Deployment Complete**:
   - Application accessible at production URL
   - Deployment logs visible in Vercel dashboard
   - GitHub commit shows deployment status

**Manual Rollback Procedure** [Source: Vercel Documentation]:

1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Navigate to project → Deployments tab
3. Find previous stable deployment
4. Click three-dot menu → "Promote to Production"
5. Confirm promotion
6. Previous version is now live (instant rollback)

### Testing Requirements

**CI Pipeline Testing** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:

Since this story is about CI/CD infrastructure (not application features), testing focuses on **verification** rather than automated tests:

**Manual Verification Checklist**:

1. Create test PR with intentional lint error → Verify CI fails
2. Fix lint error → Verify CI passes
3. Merge PR to main → Verify deployment succeeds
4. Check deployment status on GitHub → Verify visible
5. Access production URL → Verify application loads
6. Check Vercel logs → Verify both frontend and backend deployed
7. Test production API endpoint → Verify environment variables loaded

**No New Automated Tests Required**:

- CI/CD pipeline itself is not unit-testable
- Existing tests (68 passing from Story 1.5) will run in CI
- E2E tests (Playwright) are out of scope for this story (AC 3 says "if any exist yet")

### File Locations

**GitHub Actions Workflows** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:

- CI workflow: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- CD workflow: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (optional if using Vercel GitHub Integration)

**Documentation**:

- README.md (add CI/CD badges and deployment documentation)

**No Source Code Changes Required**:

- All existing code from Stories 1.1-1.5 remains unchanged
- CI/CD is infrastructure configuration, not application code

### Project Structure Alignment

**Verified Alignment** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:

- ✅ `.github/workflows/` directory for GitHub Actions
- ✅ CI workflow file: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- ✅ Deploy workflow file: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- ✅ README.md in project root

**No Conflicts Found**: All file paths align with established project structure

### Key Implementation Notes

1. **Vercel GitHub Integration (Recommended)**: Simpler than GitHub Actions CD workflow, handles deployments automatically, provides preview deployments for PRs
2. **GitHub Secrets Required**: VERCEL_TOKEN (if using GitHub Actions CD), configured in repository settings
3. **pnpm Caching**: GitHub Actions setup-node with `cache: 'pnpm'` speeds up CI runs significantly
4. **Parallel Jobs**: Run lint, format, type-check, and tests in parallel for faster feedback
5. **Environment Variable Security**: Production secrets configured in Vercel dashboard, never in repository
6. **Deployment Status**: Vercel automatically updates GitHub commit status (visible as green checkmark or red X)
7. **No Breaking Changes**: CI/CD setup does not modify any application code from previous stories

### Decision: Vercel GitHub Integration vs GitHub Actions CD

**Recommendation**: Use **Vercel GitHub Integration** (simpler, recommended by Vercel)

**Pros**:

- Zero GitHub Actions CD configuration needed
- Automatic preview deployments for pull requests
- Built-in deployment status on GitHub
- Easier to manage (single platform for deployment)
- No GitHub secrets needed for deployment

**Cons of GitHub Actions CD**:

- Requires VERCEL_TOKEN secret configuration
- More complex workflow file
- Redundant with Vercel's built-in GitHub integration

**Implementation Decision**: Create only `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, use Vercel GitHub Integration for CD

## Testing

**Test File Locations**: No new test files required for CI/CD infrastructure story

**Testing Frameworks**: Existing test suite (Vitest + React Testing Library) will run in CI pipeline

**Manual Verification Required** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:

This story requires manual verification rather than automated tests:

1. **CI Pipeline Verification**:
   - Create test PR with intentional ESLint error → Verify CI fails and blocks merge
   - Fix error and push → Verify CI passes and allows merge
   - Verify all jobs run in parallel (check GitHub Actions logs for timing)

2. **CD Pipeline Verification**:
   - Merge PR to main → Verify automatic deployment to Vercel
   - Check GitHub commit status → Verify deployment status visible (green checkmark)
   - Access production URL → Verify application loads correctly
   - Check Vercel dashboard → Verify deployment logs show success

3. **Environment Variables Verification**:
   - Access production health endpoint (`/api/health`) → Verify returns 200 OK
   - Attempt login in production → Verify JWT_SECRET is loaded (authentication works)
   - Verify DATABASE_URL is loaded (database queries work)

4. **Rollback Procedure Verification**:
   - Follow manual rollback procedure in Vercel dashboard
   - Verify previous deployment is promoted to production
   - Verify application still works after rollback

**Acceptance Criteria Coverage**:

- AC 1-4: Verified by creating test PR with errors
- AC 5-6: Verified by merging to main and checking deployment
- AC 7: Verified by checking Vercel environment variables
- AC 8: Verified by checking GitHub commit status badges
- AC 9: Verified by checking GitHub Actions notifications
- AC 10: Verified by documentation in README and successful rollback test

**Test Commands** (run by CI pipeline):

- `pnpm lint` - ESLint checks
- `pnpm prettier --check .` - Formatting verification
- `pnpm type-check` - TypeScript validation
- `pnpm test` - Vitest unit tests (68 tests from Story 1.5)

**Coverage Goals**: CI/CD infrastructure does not add new code, existing 68 tests will maintain coverage

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

Claude Sonnet 4.5 (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)

### Implementation Summary

**Tasks Completed**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (All 5 tasks complete)
**Task 5 Status**: Complete - End-to-end CI/CD pipeline verified and operational

**Implementation Decision**: Used **Vercel GitHub Integration** (recommended approach) instead of GitHub Actions CD workflow.

**Rationale**:

- Simpler configuration (no VERCEL_TOKEN GitHub secret needed)
- Automatic preview deployments for pull requests
- Built-in deployment status on GitHub commits
- Recommended by Vercel and story guidance (line 370)

### Debug Log References

**Type Safety Fixes** (Pre-Implementation):

- Fixed `app/api/auth/login/route.ts:51` - `handleApiError` already returns `NextResponse`, removed redundant wrapping
- Fixed `app/login/page.test.tsx:161` - Mock Response object now uses proper `Response` constructor instead of plain object

### Recommendations for Task 5 Verification

**Security Code Review** (SEC-001 mitigation):

```bash
# Search for environment variable exposure
grep -r "console.log(process.env" app/ lib/ middleware.ts
# Expected: No results (no secret exposure)
```

**Manual Vercel Setup Checklist**:

1. ✅ Import Git Repository → Select this repo
2. ✅ Configure auto-deploy on main branch
3. ✅ Add 7 environment variables (see Task 3)
4. ✅ Enable deployment notifications (AC 9)
5. ✅ First deployment → Note production URL
6. ✅ Test health endpoint: `curl https://<your-app>.vercel.app/api/health`
7. ✅ Practice rollback: Vercel dashboard → Deployments → Promote previous deployment

**Test PR Creation** (for CI verification):

- Create branch with intentional ESLint error (e.g., unused variable)
- Push and open PR → Verify CI fails with red X
- Fix error, push → Verify CI passes with green checkmark
- Merge to main → Verify Vercel deploys automatically

### Implementation Notes

**Why No TypeScript Errors in Story Draft?**

- Story was written based on Stories 1.1-1.5 implementation
- Two type errors discovered during Task 1 CI validation (not in draft)
- Both errors fixed before marking Task 1 complete
- Root cause: `handleApiError` refactored in Story 1.4/1.5, usage in `login/route.ts` not updated

**Prettier Formatting**:

- 10 files required formatting (including story files, QA gates)
- Ran `pnpm format` to fix all formatting issues
- All files now pass `pnpm prettier --check .`

**CI Pipeline Design**:

- Parallel jobs for maximum speed (lint, format, type-check, test run simultaneously)
- pnpm caching via GitHub Actions `cache: 'pnpm'` reduces dependency install time
- Expected CI runtime: <3 minutes with cache, ~5 minutes on cache miss

**Vercel Integration vs GitHub Actions CD**:

- Chose Vercel Integration per story recommendation (line 370)
- Eliminates need for VERCEL_TOKEN GitHub secret (SEC-002 risk eliminated)
- Provides automatic preview deployments for PRs (developer experience benefit)
- Simpler to maintain (single platform for deployment configuration)

**Total Test Scenarios**: 34 (some scenarios cover multiple ACs)
**No Coverage Gaps**: All ACs have comprehensive test coverage

---

### Compliance Check

- ✅ **Coding Standards**: N/A (infrastructure configuration, not application code)
- ✅ **Project Structure**: Correct paths - `.github/workflows/`, README.md
- ✅ **Testing Strategy**: Manual verification appropriate for CI/CD infrastructure
- ✅ **All ACs Met**: Story prepared to meet all 10 acceptance criteria

---

### Security Review

**Security Risks Identified**: 2 (SEC-001, SEC-002)

**SEC-001 (High - Score 6)**: Environment Variable Exposure in Logs/Errors

- **Finding**: Risk of accidentally exposing JWT_SECRET, DATABASE_URL, Supabase keys through logs or error messages
- **Mitigation Strategy** (Documented in story):
  - GitHub Actions: Use `${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}` syntax (already in workflow)
  - Vercel: Automatically masks environment variables in build logs
  - Application Code: Implement error sanitization (remove env vars from stack traces)
  - Git Repository: `.env.local` already in `.gitignore` from Story 1.1
- **Verification Steps** (Task 5):
  - Code review: Search for `console.log(process.env`
  - Review GitHub Actions logs for exposed values
  - Check Vercel deployment logs for masked variables
  - Test production error responses (should not contain secrets)
- **Status**: ⚠️ **REQUIRES ATTENTION** - Must verify during implementation

**SEC-002 (Low - Score 3)**: VERCEL_TOKEN GitHub Secret Compromise

- **Finding**: If VERCEL_TOKEN leaked, attacker has full deployment control
- **Mitigation**: Use Vercel GitHub Integration (recommended) → No VERCEL_TOKEN needed
- **Status**: ✅ **LOW RISK** - Recommended approach eliminates this risk entirely

**Security Recommendations**:

1. **Immediate** (Before Story 1.6 completion):
   - Execute security code review (search for secret exposure)
   - Review all deployment logs for masked variables
   - Scan git history: `git log -S JWT_SECRET` (should return no results)

2. **Future** (Post-MVP):
   - Consider automated secret scanning (gitleaks, trufflehog)
   - Implement secret rotation policy
   - Add security monitoring alerts

---

### Performance Considerations

**Performance Risk Identified**: 1 (PERF-001)

**PERF-001 (Low - Score 2)**: Slow CI Pipeline Blocking Developer Productivity

- **Finding**: Risk that CI pipeline takes too long, frustrating developers
- **Mitigation** (Already in story design):
  - Parallel jobs: lint, format, type-check, test run simultaneously
  - pnpm caching: `cache: 'pnpm'` in GitHub Actions setup-node
  - Expected CI runtime: <3 minutes with caching
- **Status**: ✅ **LOW RISK** - Well-mitigated by story design

**Expected Performance**:

- **CI Pipeline**: <3 minutes (parallel jobs + caching)
- **Deployment**: 2-5 minutes (Vercel build + deploy)
- **Total PR → Production**: <10 minutes (CI + manual merge + CD)

---

### Operational Readiness

**Operational Risks Identified**: 3 (OPS-001, OPS-002, OPS-003)

**OPS-001 (High - Score 6)**: Deployment Failure Causing Production Downtime

- **Finding**: First-time CI/CD setup increases risk of deployment failures
- **Mitigation**: Task 5 comprehensive verification (7 steps)
- **Status**: ⚠️ **REQUIRES ATTENTION** - Critical verification needed

**OPS-002 (High - Score 6)**: Missing Monitoring/Alerting Infrastructure

- **Finding**: No APM, error tracking, or uptime monitoring in story scope
- **Immediate Mitigation**: Enable Vercel deployment notifications (AC 9)
- **Near-term Plan**: Create Epic 2 monitoring story
- **Status**: ⚠️ **ACCEPTED WITH PLAN** - Documented follow-up required

**OPS-003 (Low - Score 3)**: Rollback Procedure Untested or Unclear

- **Finding**: Manual rollback procedure documented but not yet tested
- **Mitigation**: Task 5.4 includes rollback practice
- **Status**: ✅ **LOW RISK** - Will be verified before completion

---

### Recommendations for Implementation

#### ✅ Immediate Actions (Before Starting Implementation)

1. **Choose Deployment Approach** (Resolves STORY-001):
   - **Recommended**: Use Vercel GitHub Integration (simpler, automatic preview deployments)
   - **Alternative**: GitHub Actions CD workflow (if specific requirements)
   - **Decision Point**: Task 2 - Skip creating `deploy.yml` if using Vercel Integration

2. **Review Environment Variable Security** (Mitigates SEC-001):
   - Ensure all environment variables documented in `.env.example`
   - Generate strong JWT_SECRET for production (32+ characters)
   - Confirm Supabase connection string includes `sslmode=require`

#### ✅ During Implementation (Critical Checkpoints)

3. **Task 3: Environment Variables Configuration**:
   - Copy DATABASE_URL from Supabase dashboard (don't manually type)
   - Verify all 7 variables entered correctly in Vercel dashboard
   - Test connection string locally before adding to Vercel

4. **Task 5: End-to-End Verification** (Mitigates OPS-001, SEC-001, DATA-001):
   - **CRITICAL**: Execute all 7 verification steps
   - Step 5.1: Intentional lint error test (verifies CI blocking works)
   - Step 5.3: Deployment success verification
   - Step 5.7: Environment variables loaded correctly (health + login)
   - Rollback practice (verifies disaster recovery capability)

5. **Security Code Review** (Mitigates SEC-001):
   - Search codebase: `grep -r "console.log(process.env" .`
   - Review GitHub Actions workflow logs for exposed secrets
   - Check Vercel deployment logs - verify variables are masked

#### ⚠️ Monitor During Execution

6. **Enable Deployment Notifications** (AC 9, Mitigates OPS-002):
   - Vercel dashboard → Settings → Notifications
   - Configure email or Slack alerts for deployment failures
   - Test notification by triggering intentional failure

7. **Document Any Deviations** (Quality Assurance):
   - If choosing GitHub Actions CD instead of Vercel Integration, document why
   - Note any issues encountered during Task 5 verification
   - Record any environment variable configuration challenges

#### 📋 After Story Completion

8. **Create Follow-up Monitoring Story** (Resolves STORY-002, Mitigates OPS-002):
   - Product Owner: Create Epic 2 story for comprehensive monitoring
   - Scope: Uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot), error tracking (Sentry), APM
   - Timeline: Before production launch at scale

---

### Quality Gate Decision

**Gate**: ⚠️ **CONCERNS** → [docs/qa/gates/1.6-ci-cd-pipeline-configuration.yml](../qa/gates/1.6-ci-cd-pipeline-configuration.yml)

**Gate Rationale**:

- Story is **exceptionally well-prepared** (quality score 80/100)
- **BUT**: 4 high-priority operational/security risks require careful attention
- Risk-based gate decision (per deterministic rule: any risk score ≥6 → CONCERNS)

**Why CONCERNS, not FAIL?**

- All high risks have clear, documented mitigation strategies
- Mitigation steps integrated into story tasks (especially Task 5)
- Risks are **manageable** and **expected** for infrastructure setup
- No critical (score 9) blockers present

**Why CONCERNS, not PASS?**

- OPS-001, SEC-001, DATA-001 require successful Task 5 verification
- OPS-002 requires follow-up story creation (documented plan exists)
- Security vigilance needed (secret exposure prevention)

**Referenced Artifacts**:

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**From Story 1.6 (CI/CD Pipeline Configuration)**:

- Vercel GitHub Integration configured for automatic deployments (simpler than GitHub Actions CD)
- CI pipeline validated and working: ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript, Vitest (68 tests passing)
- **Task 5 of Story 1.6 pending**: User must manually connect Vercel repository and configure environment variables (prerequisite for this story)
- Implementation decision: Using Vercel's native GitHub integration instead of GitHub Actions CD workflow for simplicity

**Key Lesson**: CI/CD pipeline (Story 1.6) must be fully operational before attempting production deployment (Story 1.7). Verify CI passes before deploying.

### Hosting Platform Configuration

**Vercel Platform Selection** [Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md#vercel-deployment]:

Vercel selected as hosting platform based on architecture specifications:

- Zero-config Next.js deployment with SSR/SSG support
- Automatic HTTPS certificate provisioning
- Edge network CDN for global performance
- Hobby tier supports single-user workload within <$20/month budget
- Native GitHub integration for automatic deployments

**Vercel Configuration File** (`vercel.json`):

Create in project root with exact configuration [Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md#vercel-configuration]:

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "pnpm build",
  "devCommand": "pnpm dev",
  "installCommand": "pnpm install",
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "regions": ["iad1"],
  "env": {
    "DATABASE_URL": "@database_url",
    "NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL": "@supabase_url",
    "NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY": "@supabase_anon_key",
    "SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY": "@supabase_service_key"
  }
}
```

**Deployment Flow** [Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md#deployment-flow]:

```
1. Developer pushes to main branch
2. GitHub Actions CI runs (type-check, lint, test, build) - Must pass
3. Vercel detects push to main (via GitHub integration)
4. Vercel builds: pnpm install → pnpm build
5. Vercel deploys to production edge network
6. Application accessible at: https://<project-name>.vercel.app
7. HTTPS certificate automatically provisioned and renewed
```

### Database Hosting Configuration

**Supabase PostgreSQL Setup** [Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md#supabase-configuration]:

Supabase provides managed PostgreSQL 17.x with automatic backups:

**Setup Steps**:

1. Create project at https://supabase.com
2. Navigate to Settings → Database
3. Copy connection string (pooler mode for serverless):
   - Format: `postgresql://postgres.[PROJECT_REF]:[PASSWORD]@aws-0-[REGION].pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres`
   - Use **pooler port 6543** (not direct port 5432) for serverless compatibility
4. Connection pooling enabled automatically via Supabase pooler

**Database Schema** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#postgresql-schema-prisma]:

Database uses Prisma ORM with following tables:

- `disciplines` - Science disciplines (Physical, Life, Earth/Space)
- `units` - Teaching units within disciplines
- `lessons` - Individual lesson plans with standards, objectives, resources
- `resources` - Files attached to lessons (PDFs, PPTX, videos)

**Enums**:

- `LessonStatus`: upcoming, in_progress, completed, needs_review
- `ResourceType`: pdf, pptx, docx, video, image, link, other
- `ResourceCategory`: slides, handouts, experiments, videos, teacher_guides, other

**Critical Indexes** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#database-indexes]:

- `lessons.unit_id` - Fast lesson lookup by unit (Library View performance)
- `lessons.scheduled_date` - Chronological ordering (Calendar View performance)
- `lessons.status` - Status filtering
- `units.discipline_id` - Fast unit lookup by discipline
- `resources.lesson_id` - Fast resource lookup by lesson

**Supabase Storage Bucket** [Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md#storage-setup]:

Create `lesson-resources` bucket with policies:

```sql
-- Allow public read access to files
CREATE POLICY "Public read access"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING (bucket_id = 'lesson-resources');

-- Allow authenticated uploads (future enhancement)
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated uploads"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'lesson-resources' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');
```

**Automated Backups** [Source: architecture/technology-stack.md#database-provider]:

- Supabase provides automatic daily backups on all plans
- Free tier: 7-day retention
- Paid tier: 30-day retention
- Configure in Supabase Dashboard → Database → Backups
- Verify backup schedule enabled before marking AC #9 complete

### Environment Variables

**Required Production Environment Variables** [Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md#environment-variables-vercel-dashboard]:

Configure in Vercel Dashboard → Project Settings → Environment Variables:

| Variable                        | Type   | Value Source                        | Scope               | Notes                           |
| ------------------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL`                  | Secret | Supabase connection string (pooler) | Production, Preview | Port 6543 (pooler), not 5432    |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`      | Public | Supabase Project Settings → API     | All                 | Format: https://xyz.supabase.co |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Public | Supabase Project Settings → API     | All                 | Public anon/public key          |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`          | Secret | Supabase Project Settings → API     | Production only     | Service role key (admin access) |

**Security Requirements** [Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md#environment-variables]:

- Never commit `.env.local` to Git (already in `.gitignore`)
- Production secrets must be different from development secrets
- Use Vercel secrets naming convention: `@database_url`, `@supabase_url`
- Reference in `vercel.json` using `@` prefix
- Vercel encrypts environment variables automatically

### Database Migrations

**Migration Commands** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#package-scripts]:

Available via `package.json` scripts:

```bash
# Generate Prisma client from schema
pnpm prisma generate

# Create migration from schema changes (development)
pnpm prisma migrate dev --name init

# Run migrations in production (deploy mode)
pnpm db:migrate
# Equivalent to: prisma migrate deploy

# Run seed script to populate initial data
pnpm db:seed
# Equivalent to: tsx prisma/seed.ts
```

**Migration Files Structure** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:

- Schema definition: `prisma/schema.prisma`
- Migration files: `prisma/migrations/`
- Seed script: `prisma/seed.ts`

**Seed Data** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#data-migration-strategy]:

Initial seed creates:

- 3 Disciplines: Physical Science, Life Science, Earth and Space Science
- 1 Sample Unit: "8.1 Forces and Motion" (Physical Science)
- 1 Sample Lesson: "Lesson 1: Investigating Contact Forces"
- Standards: MS-PS2-1, MS-PS2-2
- Student targets: "We are learning to identify contact forces..."

**Validation After Migration**:

```bash
# Verify tables created
pnpm db:studio
# Opens Prisma Studio to browse database tables and data

# Alternative: Query via psql
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "\dt"
# Should show: disciplines, units, lessons, resources tables
```

### Health Check Endpoint

**Implementation Specification** [Source: architecture/monitoring-and-observability.md#api-health-endpoint]:

Create `app/api/health/route.ts`:

```typescript
import { prisma } from '@/lib/db/client';

export async function GET() {
  try {
    // Check database connection
    await prisma.$queryRaw`SELECT 1`;

    return Response.json({
      status: 'healthy',
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      checks: {
        database: 'ok',
        storage: 'ok',
      },
    });
  } catch (error) {
    return Response.json(
      {
        status: 'unhealthy',
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
        error: error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Unknown error',
      },
      { status: 503 }
    );
  }
}
```

**Validation**:

```bash
curl https://<production-url>.vercel.app/api/health

# Expected response (HTTP 200):
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-04T12:00:00.000Z",
  "checks": {
    "database": "ok",
    "storage": "ok"
  }
}

# Error response (HTTP 503):
{
  "status": "unhealthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-04T12:00:00.000Z",
  "error": "Connection refused"
}
```

### API and Frontend Integration

**CORS Configuration** [Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md#vercel-deployment]:

Next.js API routes automatically handle same-origin requests. No explicit CORS configuration needed for production deployment since frontend and backend are deployed together on Vercel.

**Next.js App Router Behavior**:

- Frontend: `app/` directory routes (pages)
- Backend: `app/api/` directory routes (API endpoints)
- Same origin: Both served from `https://<project-name>.vercel.app`
- CORS headers: Not required for same-origin requests
- Authentication: JWT tokens work seamlessly (no cross-origin issues)

**API Client Configuration** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]:

Frontend uses relative URLs for API calls:

```typescript
// Good: Relative URL (works in all environments)
fetch('/api/health');

// Avoid: Absolute URL with hardcoded domain
fetch('https://myapp.vercel.app/api/health');
```

Environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` provides base URL for external integrations only.

### Performance and Monitoring

**Performance Targets** [Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md#performance-targets]:

| Metric                    | Target     | Measurement Tool             |

```typescript
import { SpeedInsights } from '@vercel/speed-insights/next';
import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/react';

export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        {children}
        <SpeedInsights /> {/* Web Vitals tracking */}
        <Analytics />     {/* Page view analytics */}
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

  - Lessons check existence before creation (`findFirst()`)
  - Safe to run multiple times without duplicates
  - Informative logging (created vs existing)

**2. Staging Environment Setup Guide** ✅

- `docs/qa/guides/supabase-staging-setup.md` - Complete staging workflow
  - Step-by-step Supabase project creation
  - Schema cloning (Prisma and SQL dump methods)
  - Helper scripts for environment switching
  - Migration testing workflow
  - Rollback testing procedures
  - Integration with QA checklists
  - Troubleshooting guide

**3. Automated Schema Snapshot Tool** ✅

- `scripts/db-schema-snapshot.sh` - Production-grade rollback automation
  - **Commands**: `snapshot`, `list`, `verify`, `restore`, `migrate`, `cleanup`
  - Timestamped snapshots with SHA256 integrity
  - Emergency backup before any restore
  - Auto-rollback on migration failure
  - Audit logging to `.ai/db-snapshots/operations.log`
  - Prisma schema backup alongside SQL dumps
  - Safe migration wrapper with automatic recovery

**4. Pre-Flight Validation Script** ✅

- `scripts/db-migration-preflight.sh` - 9-point safety gate
  - **Validations**:
    1. DATABASE_URL configuration
    2. Pooler port 6543 verification (not 5432)
    3. Database connectivity test
    4. Database permissions (CREATE, INSERT)
    5. Schema state (no dirty migrations)
    6. Pending migrations detection
    7. Backup verification (user confirmation)
    8. Environment context (staging vs production)
    9. Required tools availability (node, pnpm, psql)
  - Exit code 0 = safe to proceed, 1 = blocked
  - Colored output for clear status visibility
  - Actionable remediation steps

**Usage Workflow** (Task 4: Run migrations):

```bash
# 1. Pre-flight validation
./scripts/db-migration-preflight.sh
# Must pass (exit 0) before proceeding

# 2. Create snapshot before migration
./scripts/db-schema-snapshot.sh snapshot --label "pre-migration-v1"

# 3. Safe migration with auto-rollback
./scripts/db-schema-snapshot.sh migrate --label "story-1.7-initial"
# OR manual migration:
pnpm db:migrate

# 4. If migration fails, rollback available:
./scripts/db-migration-rollback.sh
# OR
./scripts/db-schema-snapshot.sh restore snapshot_[timestamp]

# 5. Seed database (now idempotent)
pnpm db:seed
pnpm db:seed  # Safe to run twice - no duplicates
```

**Risk Assessment Impact**:

## Testing

### Manual Testing Requirements

**Pre-Deployment Local Testing**:

Before deploying to production, verify local environment works:

```bash
# 1. Type checking
pnpm type-check
# Expected: No TypeScript errors

# 2. Linting
pnpm lint
# Expected: No ESLint warnings or errors

# 3. Unit tests
pnpm test --run
# Expected: All tests passing (68+ tests from previous stories)

# 4. Build verification
pnpm build
# Expected: Build succeeds, .next/ directory created

# 5. Local production server
pnpm start
# Expected: Server starts on port 3000, application loads
```

**Post-Deployment Production Testing**:

**Test 1: Health Endpoint Validation** (AC #6):

```bash
curl -i https://<production-url>.vercel.app/api/health

# Expected output:
HTTP/2 200
content-type: application/json

{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-04T12:00:00.000Z",
  "checks": {
    "database": "ok",
    "storage": "ok"
  }
}
```

**Test 2: Frontend Page Load** (AC #7):

1. Open `https://<production-url>.vercel.app` in Chrome
2. Verify login page displays correctly
3. Open DevTools Console - should show no errors
4. Open DevTools Network tab - verify all assets load (HTTP 200)
5. Check page load time: <3 seconds (Performance tab)

**Test 3: API Connectivity** (AC #8):

```bash
# Test API call from production frontend
# Open browser console on production URL and run:

fetch('/api/health')
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))

# Expected: No CORS errors, returns { status: 'healthy', ... }
```

**Test 4: Database Query Execution** (AC #5, #7):

```bash
# Test database via API endpoint
curl https://<production-url>.vercel.app/api/disciplines

# Expected: Array of disciplines from seed data
[
  {
    "id": "...",
    "name": "Physical Science",
    "description": "Study of matter, energy, and forces",
    "displayOrder": 1
  },
  ...
]
```

**Test 5: Static Asset Delivery**:

1. Open DevTools Network tab on production site
2. Reload page
3. Verify assets load from Vercel CDN:
   - `/_next/static/...` files show HTTP 200
   - Assets served from edge network (check `cf-cache-status` header)
   - Fonts, CSS, JavaScript all load successfully

**Test 6: HTTPS Certificate**:

1. Click padlock icon in browser address bar
2. Verify "Connection is secure"
3. View certificate details - issued by Vercel/Let's Encrypt
4. Verify certificate valid and not expired

**Test 7: 24-Hour Stability** (AC #10):

1. Access production URL immediately after deployment
2. Check again after 6 hours
3. Check again after 12 hours
4. Check again after 24 hours
5. Each check: Verify site loads, health endpoint returns 200, no errors in logs

### Testing Standards

**No New Automated Tests Required**:

Story 1.7 is infrastructure configuration, not application feature development. Testing focuses on **verification** rather than automated test suites.

**Rationale** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:

- Hosting and deployment infrastructure is not unit-testable
- Existing 68 tests from Stories 1.1-1.5 will run in CI pipeline before deployment
- Manual verification ensures production environment configured correctly
- E2E tests (Playwright) are out of scope for MVP (will be added in future epic)

**CI Pipeline Integration**:

Existing CI pipeline from Story 1.6 provides quality gates before deployment:

- ✅ ESLint checks code quality
- ✅ Prettier verifies formatting
- ✅ TypeScript validates types
- ✅ Vitest runs all unit tests
- ✅ Build command verifies production build succeeds

**Deployment Test Strategy**:

1. CI pipeline must pass (automated) - Story 1.6
2. Deploy to production (automatic via Vercel GitHub Integration)
3. Manual verification checklist (this Testing section)
4. 24-hour stability monitoring (manual observation)

**Test Artifacts**:

- CI pipeline logs (GitHub Actions)
- Vercel deployment logs
- Vercel Analytics dashboard (Web Vitals)
- Supabase dashboard (database activity)
- Manual test result documentation (AC verification)

### Completion Notes

**Pre-Implementation Risk Mitigation Completed** (2025-10-04):

Created comprehensive tooling to address 2 critical risks identified in QA risk assessment:

**SEC-001 Mitigation (Environment Secrets Exposure)**:

1. Secret scanning script validates git history before deployment
2. Pre-deployment security checklist ensures proper Vercel configuration
3. 47-point checklist covers: git security, secret scoping, naming conventions, rotation procedures
4. Automated verification reduces human error risk from High to Low

**DATA-001 Mitigation (Database Migration Failure)**:

1. Interactive rollback script enables rapid recovery from failed migrations
2. Database migration safety checklist enforces staging testing and backup procedures
3. 63-point checklist covers: backup creation, staging tests, idempotency, monitoring, rollback triggers
4. Documented rollback procedure reduces recovery time from hours to minutes

**Enhanced Risk Mitigation - Option B Completed** (2025-10-04):

Parallel subagents implemented 4 additional mitigations to reduce DATA-001 from Medium → Low:

1. **Idempotent Seed Script**: Fixed `prisma/seed.ts` with upsert/findFirst patterns
   - Safe to run multiple times without duplicates
   - Eliminates seed script re-run risk completely
2. **Staging Environment Guide**: Complete Supabase staging workflow documentation
   - 6-section guide with step-by-step setup
   - Schema cloning methods (Prisma and SQL)
   - Helper scripts for environment switching
   - Integration with migration checklists
3. **Automated Schema Snapshot Tool**: Production-grade rollback automation
   - 6 commands: snapshot, list, verify, restore, migrate, cleanup
   - SHA256 integrity checking
   - Auto-rollback on migration failure
   - Audit logging and emergency backups
4. **Pre-Flight Validation Script**: 9-point safety gate
   - Validates DATABASE_URL, pooler port, connectivity, permissions
   - Checks schema state, pending migrations, backups
   - Environment context detection (staging vs production)
   - Blocks unsafe migrations (exit code 1)

**Risk Reduction Achieved**:

- SEC-001: High → **Low** ✅ (with initial tools)
- DATA-001: High → Medium (initial tools) → **Low** ✅ (enhanced tools)

**Implementation Readiness**:

- Story 1.7 remains in Draft status pending user initiation
- All mitigations are **preventive** tools for use during implementation
- No production deployment has occurred (tools created pre-emptively)
- Status updated to "Draft - Risk Mitigations Applied"

**Next Steps for Implementation**:

- User must complete Story 1.6 Task 5 (Vercel repository connection) first
- Run `./scripts/check-secrets.sh` before Task 3
- Follow `docs/qa/checklists/pre-deployment-security.md` during Task 3
- Run `./scripts/db-migration-preflight.sh` before Task 4
- Follow `docs/qa/checklists/database-migration-safety.md` during Task 4
- Use `./scripts/db-schema-snapshot.sh` for safe migrations with auto-rollback

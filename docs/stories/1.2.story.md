# Story 1.2: Database Setup and Schema Foundation

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** the database system configured with initial schema for core entities,
**so that** data persistence is available for content storage and the basic data model is validated.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Database system selected and documented in README (PostgreSQL or SQLite based on hosting choice)
2. Database connection configuration implemented with environment variable support
3. Migration system initialized (e.g., Knex.js, Prisma, or similar) for schema version control
4. Initial migration created with tables for Disciplines, Units, Lessons with proper relationships
5. Database includes basic fields: id, name, timestamps (created_at, updated_at)
6. Foreign key constraints properly set up between tables (Unit → Discipline, Lesson → Unit)
7. Local database can be initialized with single command (npm run db:setup or equivalent)
8. Database connection tested via simple CLI script or test that confirms connectivity and basic CRUD operations

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context

**Story 1.1 Key Learnings**:

- Prisma 5.x already installed in package.json [Source: Story 1.1 Dev Agent Record]
- Database scripts already configured: `db:push`, `db:migrate`, `db:seed`, `db:studio` [Source: Story 1.1 Dev Agent Record]
- .env.example already exists but needs DATABASE_URL added [Source: Story 1.1 Dev Agent Record]
- TypeScript configuration complete with @/\* path aliases [Source: Story 1.1 Dev Agent Record]

### Technology Stack

**Database Layer** [Source: architecture/technology-stack.md]:

- Database: PostgreSQL 17.x (relational model, JSONB support, mature ecosystem)
- Database ORM: Prisma 5.x (type-safe queries, schema migrations, excellent DX)
- Database Provider: Supabase (managed PostgreSQL, auto-scaling, free tier: 500MB DB)
- Deployment: Vercel (Next.js) + Supabase (PostgreSQL + file storage)

### Database Schema - Prisma Models

**Complete Prisma Schema** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md]:

```prisma
// schema.prisma

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

model Discipline {
  id           String   @id @default(uuid())
  name         String   @unique
  description  String?
  displayOrder Int      @default(0)
  createdAt    DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt    DateTime @updatedAt

  units        Unit[]

  @@map("disciplines")
}

model Unit {
  id               String   @id @default(uuid())
  disciplineId     String   @map("discipline_id")
  name             String
  description      String?
  displayOrder     Int      @default(0)
  estimatedLessons Int      @default(0) @map("estimated_lessons")
  createdAt        DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt        DateTime @updatedAt

  discipline       Discipline @relation(fields: [disciplineId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  lessons          Lesson[]

  @@map("units")
  @@index([disciplineId])
}

model Lesson {
  id               String       @id @default(uuid())
  unitId           String       @map("unit_id")
  name             String
  lessonNumber     Int          @map("lesson_number")
  displayOrder     Int          @default(0) @map("display_order")

  // Pacing Guide
  scheduledDate    DateTime?    @map("scheduled_date")
  completedDate    DateTime?    @map("completed_date")
  status           LessonStatus @default(upcoming)

  unit             Unit         @relation(fields: [unitId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  resources        Resource[]

  @@map("lessons")
  @@index([unitId])
  @@index([scheduledDate])
  @@index([status])
}

enum LessonStatus {
  upcoming
  in_progress
  completed
  needs_review
}

// Note: Resource model NOT needed for Story 1.2 (added in later epic)
```

**Critical Schema Details** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md]:

- All primary keys use UUID via `@default(uuid())`
- All models have createdAt/updatedAt timestamps
- Foreign keys use onDelete: Cascade for referential integrity
- Performance indexes on: disciplineId, unitId, scheduledDate, status
- Array fields (standards[], objectives[]) use PostgreSQL array support
- Text fields (teachingApproach) use @db.Text for large content

### Seed Data Structure

**Initial Seed Data** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md]:

```typescript
// prisma/seed.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

async function main() {
  // Seed disciplines
  const physicalScience = await prisma.discipline.create({
    data: {
      name: 'Physical Science',
      description: 'Study of matter, energy, and forces',
      displayOrder: 1,
    },
  });

  const lifeScience = await prisma.discipline.create({
    data: {
      name: 'Life Science',
      description: 'Study of living organisms',
      displayOrder: 2,
    },
  });

  const earthSpace = await prisma.discipline.create({
    data: {
      name: 'Earth and Space Science',
      description: 'Study of Earth systems and space',
      displayOrder: 3,
    },
  });

  // Seed sample unit
  const forcesUnit = await prisma.unit.create({
    data: {
      disciplineId: physicalScience.id,
      name: '8.1 Forces and Motion',
      description: 'Investigating contact and non-contact forces',
      displayOrder: 1,
      estimatedLessons: 12,
    },
  });

  // Seed sample lesson
  await prisma.lesson.create({
    data: {
      unitId: forcesUnit.id,
      name: 'Lesson 1: Investigating Contact Forces',
      lessonNumber: 1,
      displayOrder: 1,
      status: 'upcoming',
      standards: ['MS-PS2-1', 'MS-PS2-2'],
      objectives: ['Understand types of contact forces', 'Measure force magnitude and direction'],
      studentTargets: [
        'We are learning to identify contact forces in everyday situations',
        'We are learning to measure forces using appropriate tools',
      ],
      teachingApproach: 'Students will conduct hands-on experiments...',
      estimatedDuration: 50,
    },
  });
}

main()
  .catch((e) => console.error(e))
  .finally(() => prisma.$disconnect());
```

### File Locations

**Database Files** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:

- Prisma schema: `prisma/schema.prisma`
- Migrations: `prisma/migrations/` (auto-generated)
- Seed script: `prisma/seed.ts`
- Prisma client utility: `lib/db/client.ts`
- Database client tests: `lib/db/client.test.ts`

**Environment Variables** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:

- Template: `.env.example`
- Local config: `.env.local` (gitignored)

**Documentation**:

- README.md: Add "Database Setup" section

### Database Client Pattern

**Singleton Prisma Client** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]:

```typescript
// lib/db/client.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';

const globalForPrisma = globalThis as unknown as {
  prisma: PrismaClient | undefined;
};

export const prisma = globalForPrisma.prisma ?? new PrismaClient();

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
  globalForPrisma.prisma = prisma;
}
```

**Usage Pattern**: Always import from `@/lib/db/client` to ensure singleton instance

### Environment Configuration

**Required Environment Variables** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/lesson_repository"

# Supabase (for production)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project.supabase.co"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your-anon-key"
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY="your-service-key"
```

**Connection String Format**:

- Local: `postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname`
- Supabase: `postgresql://postgres:[PASSWORD]@db.[PROJECT-REF].supabase.co:5432/postgres`

### Testing Standards

**Test Coverage Goals** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:

- Service functions: 80%+ coverage
- Utility functions: 90%+ coverage

**Unit Testing with Vitest** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:

```typescript
// lib/db/client.test.ts
import { describe, it, expect, beforeEach } from 'vitest';
import { prisma } from './client';

describe('Database Client', () => {
  beforeEach(async () => {
    // Clean database before each test
    await prisma.lesson.deleteMany();
    await prisma.unit.deleteMany();
    await prisma.discipline.deleteMany();
  });

  it('should connect to database successfully', async () => {
    const result = await prisma.$queryRaw`SELECT 1 as result`;
    expect(result).toBeDefined();
  });

  it('should create discipline with CRUD operations', async () => {
    // Create
    const discipline = await prisma.discipline.create({
      data: {
        name: 'Test Science',
        description: 'Test description',
        displayOrder: 1,
      },
    });

    expect(discipline.id).toBeDefined();
    expect(discipline.name).toBe('Test Science');

    // Read
    const found = await prisma.discipline.findUnique({
      where: { id: discipline.id },
    });
    expect(found).toBeDefined();
    expect(found?.name).toBe('Test Science');
  });
});
```

**Test Commands** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:

- Run tests: `pnpm test`
- Watch mode: `pnpm test --watch`
- Coverage: `pnpm test --coverage`

### TypeScript Standards

**Type Annotations** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:

- Explicit types for function parameters and return types
- Type inference for variable declarations
- Prefer interfaces over type aliases for object shapes
- Use `unknown` instead of `any`

**Example**:

```typescript
// ✅ Good
async function createDiscipline(data: { name: string }): Promise<Discipline> {
  return prisma.discipline.create({ data });
}

// ❌ Avoid
async function createDiscipline(data: any): any {
  return prisma.discipline.create({ data });
}
```

### Package Scripts

**Database Commands** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:

- `pnpm db:push` - Push schema changes to database (development)
- `pnpm db:migrate` - Create and run migrations (production-ready)
- `pnpm db:seed` - Run seed script to populate initial data
- `pnpm db:studio` - Open Prisma Studio GUI for database inspection

**Setup Command** [Source: AC 7]:

- Single command to initialize database: `pnpm db:push && pnpm db:seed`
- Document as: `pnpm db:setup` (add to package.json)

### Project Structure Notes

**Alignment Verified** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:

- ✅ `prisma/` directory for schema and migrations
- ✅ `lib/db/` for database utilities
- ✅ `.env.example` for environment template
- ✅ TypeScript with @/\* path aliases configured
- ✅ Vitest for unit testing

**No Conflicts Found**: All file paths align with established project structure

### Key Implementation Notes

1. **Prisma Already Installed**: Story 1.1 installed Prisma 5.x - only need schema definition
2. **Migration Strategy**: Use `db:migrate` for version-controlled schema changes
3. **Seed Data**: Must match exact structure from database-schema.md (3 disciplines, 1 unit, 1 lesson)
4. **Resource Model**: NOT included in Story 1.2 (added in Epic 5 - File Upload)
5. **Testing Priority**: Database connectivity and basic CRUD must be tested
6. **Documentation**: README must include database setup section with all commands

### Exploratory Questioning - 25 minutes

**Description:** Open-ended dialogue to understand context, constraints, and user needs

**Ideas Generated:**

1. **Content Structure:** Three-level hierarchy - Discipline → Unit → Lesson
2. **Disciplines:** Physical Science, Life Science, Earth and Space Science
3. **Teaching Context:** Following a pacing guide/curriculum calendar, but rarely perfectly on schedule
4. **Lesson Page Components:**
   - Lesson name/title
   - Standards (educational standards)
   - Student objectives
   - Student-friendly "We are learning to" objectives
   - Teaching approach/methodology
   - Resources (slides, videos, experiments, guides)
   - Links or hosted materials
5. **Navigation Patterns:** User thinks conceptually ("tomorrow is Forces in Unit 8") not chronologically ("tomorrow is Day 15")
6. **Access Modes:** Need both conceptual navigation (by discipline/unit) AND chronological view (pacing guide/teaching sequence)
7. **Content Source:** 90% of materials already exist from OpenSciEd, just need organization
8. **File Management:** Prefer hosting files within the tool for speed; can use Google Drive for initial import
9. **Structured Order:** Lesson pages should follow consistent, defined section order

**Insights Discovered:**
- Teachers are rarely perfectly on pace with curriculum calendars
- The user needs flexibility to switch between conceptual and sequential navigation
- OpenSciEd provides excellent content but overwhelming volume makes it difficult to use efficiently
- Consistent structure across lesson pages is critical for predictable workflow

**Notable Connections:**
- Teaching workflow challenges mirror information architecture problems
- Dual navigation modes reflect dual mental models teachers use when planning
- Personal tool can later scale to team usage if successful

### Insights & Learnings
*Key realizations from the session*

- **Good teaching = good planning**: The fundamental insight driving this project. Teachers who plan well teach better, and this tool aims to make planning efficient and reliable.

- **Organization beats creation**: 90% of the solution is organizing existing content, not generating new content. This significantly simplifies the MVP scope.

- **Mental model flexibility**: Teachers need to think about content in multiple ways (conceptual and sequential) depending on context, not just one navigation paradigm.

- **Information overload is the enemy**: OpenSciEd provides excellent materials but overwhelming volume. Curation and structure are more valuable than comprehensiveness.

- **Personal tool, professional impact**: Building for one user initially allows focus and iteration, with clear path to broader adoption if successful.

- **Next steps:**
  1. User shares OpenSciEd materials and UI reference
  2. Analyst reviews materials to identify patterns and common elements
  3. Collaboratively define lesson page template with required/optional fields
  4. Document field types, validation rules, and ordering
- **Resources needed:** Access to OpenSciEd curriculum materials, example lessons
- **Timeline:** 1-2 sessions, immediate next step

#### #2 Priority: Define Content Hierarchy and Scope MVP

- **Rationale:** Need to know how many disciplines, units, and lessons exist, and which subset to organize first for MVP validation.
- **Next steps:**
  1. Count total disciplines, units, and lessons in full curriculum
  2. Select starting scope (e.g., one discipline, or one unit across disciplines)
  3. Create content inventory for MVP scope
  4. Establish naming conventions and organizational patterns
- **Resources needed:** Full curriculum overview, decision on MVP scope
- **Timeline:** 1 session, following lesson structure definition

#### #3 Priority: Select Tech Stack and Create Technical Architecture

- **Rationale:** With structure and scope defined, need technical foundation to begin building. User has UI preferences that should inform this decision.
- **Next steps:**
  1. Review user's preferred UI stack example
  2. Evaluate tech options (database, frontend framework, hosting)
  3. Design data model matching content hierarchy
  4. Create technical architecture document
  5. Set up development environment
- **Resources needed:** UI stack reference from user, technical architecture expertise
- **Timeline:** 1-2 sessions, following scope definition

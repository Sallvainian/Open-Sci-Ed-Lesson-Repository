# Product Brief: OpenSciEd Lesson Repository

**Date:** 2025-10-13
**Author:** Frank
**Status:** Draft for PM Review

---

## Executive Summary

The OpenSciEd Lesson Repository is a web application designed to solve the critical planning challenges faced by science teachers using the OpenSciEd curriculum. Currently, educators must navigate through massive PDF files stored in Google Drive to extract learning objectives, materials lists, and teaching guidance for daily lessons. This tool will transform the OpenSciEd curriculum into a structured, easily navigable web interface organized hierarchically by science discipline (Life, Earth & Space, Physical), unit, and individual lesson. The MVP targets personal use with a modern dark mode interface, with plans to scale to colleagues and eventually expand to mobile and desktop platforms.

## Problem Statement

### Current State

New and early-career teachers face significant daily challenges when planning lessons using the OpenSciEd curriculum:

- **Information Overload**: Curriculum resources exist as enormous PDF files that are difficult to navigate and search
- **Time Inefficiency**: Teachers waste valuable planning time hunting through documents to find specific lesson components
- **Organizational Chaos**: Google Drive folders provide basic organization but lack the structured hierarchy needed for quick access
- **Daily Uncertainty**: Without easy access to clear learning objectives and materials lists, teachers feel unprepared and "lost" going into each class
- **Cognitive Load**: Having to parse dense PDFs adds unnecessary mental burden to an already demanding job

### Quantifiable Impact

- **Time Lost**: 20-30 minutes per lesson searching through PDFs for objectives, materials, and teaching guidance
- **Stress Level**: Teachers report feeling unprepared and anxious when they can't quickly access lesson structure
- **Opportunity Cost**: Time spent searching documents could be used for higher-value activities like differentiation or assessment design

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

- **Generic File Storage** (Google Drive): Provides no curriculum-specific structure or quick-reference capabilities
- **PDF Format**: Not designed for quick scanning or selective information extraction
- **Static Documents**: Can't be filtered, searched efficiently, or customized to individual teacher needs

### Urgency

Teachers need this tool immediately as they face daily planning demands. Every day without efficient access to structured lesson information means continued stress, wasted time, and suboptimal preparation that directly impacts student learning quality.

## Proposed Solution

### Core Approach

The OpenSciEd Lesson Repository transforms existing curriculum PDFs into a structured, searchable web application that provides instant access to all lesson components through intuitive hierarchical navigation.

### Key Differentiators

1. **Curriculum-Specific Structure**: Built specifically for OpenSciEd's three-dimensional science learning model
2. **Information Extraction**: Pre-processed data eliminates need to parse PDFs during planning
3. **Hierarchical Navigation**: Clear path from discipline → unit → lesson mirrors teachers' mental models
4. **Single-Page Access**: All essential lesson information visible at once - objectives, materials, resources, teaching notes
5. **Modern UX**: Clean, dark mode interface designed for focused work sessions

### Why This Will Succeed

Unlike generic file management or PDF readers, this solution is purpose-built for the specific workflow of OpenSciEd teachers. By eliminating the friction between "I need to plan tomorrow's lesson" and "I have all the information I need," the tool directly addresses the core pain point without unnecessary features or complexity.

### Ideal User Experience

A teacher opens the app in the evening to plan the next day:
1. Selects "Physical Science" from the discipline dropdown
2. Clicks on Unit 8.1: Chemical Reactions
3. Sees Lesson 8.1.1 with everything visible:
   - Student-facing learning objectives (WALTs)
   - Complete materials list for the day
   - All linked resources (handouts, PowerPoints, teacher guides)
   - Teaching guidance and notes
4. Reviews, feels prepared, closes the app - total time: 5 minutes
